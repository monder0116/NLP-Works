Tayari s Blog  There s A Sucker Born Every Minute

And apparently  they all go to work in publishing 
This has been a bad week for liars  First the holocaust survivor who said she was literally
raised by wolves turns out to be just a regular  if depressed  person  Now  Margaret
Seltzer  the author of Love and
Consequences   the highly acclaimed  memoir  about her life as a half Native American half
White gang banger  has been been explosed as a fraud 
In the vividly told book  Ms  Seltzer wrote about her African American foster brothers 
Terrell and Taye  who joined the Bloods gang when they were 11 and 13  She chronicled her
experiences making drug deliveries for gang leaders at age 13 and how she was given her first
gun as a birthday present when she was 14  Ms  Seltzer told The Times last week  “One of the
first things I did once I started making drug money was to buy a burial plot ”
It s like a satire of a satire  This is my favorite line in the whole NYT article   Sarah
McGrath  the editor at Riverhead who worked with Ms  Seltzer for three years on the book  said
she was stunned to discover that the author had lied   Gotta love that understatement and comic
timing 
But seriously  you may remember an article last summer that appered in TimeOut New York
about matters of race in publishing   My post on the subject here    This
was one of most important quotes from the article  “Invariably ” says Craig  “a
black themed book will come up for consideration  and there won’t be anyone of color to put in
an opinion  or there’ll be one  who shouldn’t bear the burden alone  So we all pretend we’re
experts  Maybe I’m the only one who’s embarrassed by that ” The end result of such
roundtables  one can only fear  could be that the only books depicting people of color that
get published are those that do not challenge white assumptions 
I can t help but wonder if Ms  Seltzer s book with all it s far fetched 
tales from the urban jungle flair  would have passed the smell test were it read by a more
diverse panel of editors  
Comment  1  by carleen 
I read that article in the Times and IMMEDIATELY thought it was going to be a hoax  But then
I thought  surely after all the others  she had been vetted to heaven and back  Ha! Guess I m
a sucker too

Detroit and the Myth of the $100 House | Uprooted  an eco travel
blog
America s Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the
Industrial Era and now lie    well  rusting    as empty remainders of glory days
past 
Chief among these is Detroit  Motor City  The longtime center of American
automotive manufacturing was gutted when the Big Three car companies
simultaneously failed 
Detroit  already plagued by corruption and crime  saw its unemployment rate
skyrocket in 2009 
What s left behind when an economy collapses? Cheap real estate  that s what 
I d read a New
York Times article about some forward thinking artist types who bought a house in Detroit for $1 900   $1 900! Some of us
 and lots of New Yorkers  pay that much in rent every month!
In fact  the article went on  soon a nearby house went on the market for $100 
The artist types notified their buddies  who moved in post haste 
I was intrigued  Really? A $100 house? Even if it was a real
fixer upper  even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in
it  that d still be a hell of a deal  Why  out in New Mexico  where you can
still buy unincorporated land with no water or roads  you d pay at least $1 000
for a house sized plot of dust  So how can you buy an actual home for $100? That s literally cheaper than dirt 
The possibilities of this were fascinating  I had visions of hipsters from coast
to coast converging in Detroit  building a new city on rock&roll  I pictured
young artists owning homes  fixing up neighborhoods  I saw community gardens 
art parks  a grassroots transformation of a city  We could take that oil stained
soil and those rusted factories  and create something new and beautiful  With
houses going for $100  I thought   what would you have to lose
by moving to Detroit?
And so Quiet Earp and I did some research  and came up with a list of houses
selling for under a grand  We had plenty to choose from  there were more cheap
houses than we would have time to visit  We picked two neighborhoods to cruise 
and dove in 
But once we entered Detroit  the truth hit fast  this is a modern American ghost
town  The place is practically deserted  Its streets  built wide to accommodate
heavy traffic  are mostly empty  Houses and businesses are boarded up  painted
up  bombed out and falling down  Even in the center of the business district 
there s no traffic and hardly any people 
Dont believe me? I videotaped it 
It got worse as we drove into residential areas  looking for those cheap houses 
In fact  I ve never felt so out of place in all my life  
Even in Chicago s South Side  where we counted five white people in an hour  I
felt fine just driving around  not so in Detroit  Truthfully  it wasn t about
race  it was about being naive  It was about driving down streets where we truly
did not belong and were not welcome 
Detroit is a ghost town  and it s inhabited by ghosts  the only people left here
are those who can t or won t leave  They live in deserted neighborhoods  in
houses with collapsed front steps and missing windows  They sit on the porch and
watch the cars go by  watch the deals go down  watch their neighborhoods
crumble  And we  driving through slowly and reading house numbers in a
late model Honda  stuck out like a couple of thumbs 
So we sped up  and went straight to the houses  Sometimes we stopped to take a
photo  but mostly we didn t  Earp and I have each lived happily in the wilds of
West Oakland  but the danger I felt in Detroit was like nothing I d experienced
before  I was actually afraid for my life 
The New York Times correspondent wrote that his friend Mitch s $1 900 home  had
already been stripped of its appliances and wiring     But for Mitch that only
added to its appeal  because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with
solar heating  solar electricity and low cost  high efficiency appliances  
As for the $100 house? It  needed some work  a hole patched  some windows
replaced  
Well  I don t know what part of Detroit these folks live in  but the $100 houses
I saw looked more like this 
You see  abandoned houses in this town get set on fire  No exceptions  Wherever
we went in those neighborhoods  one in four houses had been torched  On one
corner  we saw a giant banner hung across a charred front porch  We didn t slow
down to take a photo  but I ll paraphrase  DON T BURN
HOUSES DOWN! DETROIT POLICE ARE WATCHING YOU!
Except that they obviously aren t  People who live in this part of town are on
their own  And although I and many others would love to own even a fire scarred 
condemned building  the fact is that we wouldn t last a week here  Buy a $100
house in Detroit  and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights  you ll
spend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists  murderers and
crackheads to break in the windows 
It s like the Wild West without the scenery  the gold  and the hope  It s the
Rust Belt 

Ultimately  I do believe that change will come to Detroit  There
will be a green movement here   in fact it s already being cultivated by
forward thinking
groups and 
intrepid locals   One day  this place will be reborn 
But right now  the NYT s story reeks of Shinola 
Truth is  any artist type who moves into this part of Detroit is
probably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun   Anyone who takes this
plunge is risking their life every day  betting on a future that may take a long
time to arrive 
Long story short  Yes  you can buy a house in Detroit
for $100  And you will get what you pay for 
Cheers to Toby Barlow   who inspired my trek to Detroit  and who believes in a
happier  greener future  May your every dream come true  sir  and your book
sell fabulously

Great post  Thank you for this info  I need that
Myself 19  Sep  2009 at 10 06 am 

Please track down and watch a movie called  Detroit  A City to Yourself   by
Nicole MacDonald  It s full of this imagery  and talks about the 1805 fire
and rebuilding  and the post industrial devastation that s ravaged the city
since 
Most poignantly  it talks about Hurricane Katrina  which focused attention on
rebuilding another city with this level of devastation  and how without a
single catastrophic event to blame for it  Detroit s decay has gone
unsympathetically ignored 
The movie wraps up by observing this  how abandoned buildings and spaces are
being reclaimed by nature  About the pop fiction which explores the concept
of a post human world  and how it already exists now  And about how  if
you re a pheasant  that s not such a bad thing 
HOWEVER     
There s a lot more to Detroit than that  There are industrial spaces being
turned into low rent artist lofts and business incubators   Look at the
Russell Industrial Complex  for one example   There are neighborhoods that
refuse to cave   west of Livernois around McNichols   There s a whole bunch
of nice stuff happening along the riverfront  from downtown up towards Stroh
Place 
And there s always Belle Isle  When friends come to Detroit  I take them
there  It s our in the river park  982 acres of green space  with a zoo  a
botanical garden and conservatory  rentable paddle boats  and tons of other
neat stuff  Next time you re in Detroit  please head over  Oh  and entry is
free  so it s available to anyone regardless of economic status  You re
liable to see families picnicking  bums gathering bottles and cans  geese
foraging  and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods  Within a
hundred yards of each other 
Some of that cheap real estate isn t too horrible  either  There s a whole
street being taken over by artists  Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall 
Some of the things they ve done down there are amazing  and the community
garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood  A few weeks ago 
someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools  Think about that
for a moment  hoes and shovels don t have enough pawn value to be worth
carrying out  Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own
garden 
Yes  Detroit s got more than its share of bad spots  you re right  I ve lived
in the metro area my whole life  and there are areas  I can t call them
neighborhoods  down there where I don t feel safe in daytime  much less at
night  But there are bright spots  and behind every one of them is a person 
or a bunch of people  who refuse to give up 
Jessica 19  Sep  2009 at 10 30 am
Myself    Thanks for the comment and the great information  You are exactly
the kind of person who gives me back the hope I lost on my way into town 
Seems there s a pretty solid group of Detroit residents who are truly
committed to restoring the city  and that s beautiful to see 
Love the fact that people are stealing garden implements  though it s still
sad that they need to  
I will absolutely watch A City To Yourself  thank you for the recommendation 
And when I m in the area again  I ll go out to Belle Isle and think
long&hard about the future of American cities  as I m sure you do
occasionally too 
Reader Not Writer 20  Sep  2009 at 10 17 pm

Well  growing up not far from Detroit myself  I would point out a few
things 
1  Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn t really going to get
you welcomed with open arms  See  there s a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3
and driving a foreign car doesn t really scream  solidarity  to those
struggling to survive  Most of the funny looks you got were less about your
color than about your ride  You think I m kidding  but I couldn t be more
serious    that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American
consumer has left Detroit in the dust 
2  Detroit  proper  has been dying for a long time    before the 1968 riots 
even  Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those
pockets of innovation  creativity  and vision  But its not going to happen
with the investment of $100 into a single house  Someone will need to begin
by creating an urban  oasis  that mitigates some of the fears that you had
while driving through the city    where to buy groceries  a place where you
can feel safe on your own front porch  the freedom to sleep soundly without
worrying about your copper wiring 
3  For all that is wrong with Detroit    and that s nearly everything   
you d be astonished by the pride that Detroiters have for their city  They
lack the means to build her back to her former glory  but she won t be
abandoned  For all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances 
there are just as many who insist that they wouldn t live anywhere else 

Raggedy Anarchy 21  Sep  2009 at 7 21 pm 
Thank you for the opportunity to see post BushCo era Detroit through the
prism of your vision 
I ve never been there  but ever since that mad  possessed American History
Professor I had  I ve been haunted by Detroit  No  even before that    
The Dollmaker  has often been called  America s least pretentious
masterpiece    Joyce Carol Oates in the NYTBR 
When folks like Gertie Nevels  and Levon Helm and John Hiatt and my favorite 
John Henry  left the mountains to go wrestle with the Industrial leviathan
in Detroit  they were in it to the death  Detroit won t be the death of the
courage of those early Detroit pioneers  it looks like Nature will prevail
after all  Everybody wins 
I love what you are doing

Is this the monument left behind for the world to witness  by Corporatism 
Capitalism? Is this the greatness they built on earth? Is this the proof
that all countries deserve democracy and its inevitable cancers  corporatism
and capitalism? We die in war to bring this to other countries? This 
American Glory? In a class less society? This is the final phase  the
crowning glory of America s greatness? Does this show our system s
superiority over the commies in China? The old Soviet Guard? Europe s
follies? Have we really built a  Great Society  or is that all propaganda   
Bull Shiite to hush free thought  eyes to the flag  while our pockets and
resources were raided by shysters  spin meisters  schmucks and banksters?
Did we build sane  sustainable  survival shelter homes? Do we still have
fertile backyard gardens  filled with the composting of the age? Can any of
what we built be recovered  restored  renovated  into useful shelter? Did
the tools of production really get sold  to the shareholders benefit 
leaving the worker without means to defend himself? Have the great fortunes
earned in trust as  American  for American investment here in America 
really migrated to the Beijing  Shanghai  and Hang Seng markets  converted
to safer  Yuan  and invested in China s wealth? Did this really happen to
American patriots? Do you still love democracy  corporatism  capitalism and
all it has done for you? Are you really  Free ? Is Conscription just around
the corner  to serve Halliburton Dubai  in attaining pipeline clearance
through Afghanistan  to Turkmenistan and the oil field there? Are American
lives well spent in thei  Middle East  endevor? Are we just mercenaries for
big oil  not liberators spreading  Freedom ? Is this really just flag waving
propaganda? What  exactly did we win in Iraq? Cheaper Oil? I think not!
Gratitude of a Free nation? I think not! Why has the  Rust Belt  come into
being? What were we doing? Where did the great society for all  the one we
were told we were building go? Japan? China? To the Uber Rich? As we sink
into our own ruins  the dark horse rides on America! The dark horse rides
on! Sad 
Lumpy 22  Oct  2009 at 3 14 pm
Green movement? You gotta be kidding me! Earth to Jessica  Democrats caused
this  They have the unmidas touch  Every decaying city in America has D s
firmly in control  and has forever 
When you said you were naive  you weren t kidding 
Jessica Reeder 22  Oct  2009 at 3 36 pm 
Nope  I wasn t kidding  Put it in writing  didn t I?
Lumpy  I m not a Democrat and I don t much approve of the Democratic Party 
Just so we re clear on that  I don t think you present a fully informed
argument on the causes of urban decay  but I don t disagree with you 
I m not particularly interested in whose fault this mess is  rather  I choose
to focus on how we re going to clean it up  That s where the green movement
comes in  and when I say  green  I m talking plants not politics 
If you ve got some fancy new technology at Boeing that can do more for
people s health and happiness  and for less cost  than a victory garden can
do  please let me know 
Raggedy Anarchy 24  Oct  2009 at 6 17 pm

Last I checked  greed  sloth  hubris and waste were all pretty universally
human traits  and I see no halos around either Libertarians  Dems or even
anarchically green at heart 
I agree    Democrats  like country music  have disappointed me too many times
in the past for me to keep on listening  But here s the thing    frogs are
mutating due to the planet trying to kill itself  Salmon have forgot how to
screw  Otters in post Valdez Alaska are clawing their own
petro chemical burned eyes out in pain 
The patient is earth  and it s not getting better  You want to yell at which
insurance company fucked up  or change a bedpan  so to speak? During times
of crisis  which this is   the ones who will create positive change are
those who accept the hand they are dealt and act  The ones who are educated
and informed and attached to delegating moral judgements will be perfectly
equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists  Just ask the
Palestinians who left after the first war to cry over the past  Or ask my
Paiute grandfather   Or even Friend Salmon  who still haunts my dreams and
tells me not to let us blow each other s asses off the earth until we clean
up the mess we have made 
That was for Lumpy  Nobody gets laughed at alone in my presence

I find this topic fascinating  I was born in a suburb of Detroit and most of
family still lives there  I will be going back to visit in June  I plan to
take a  Daytime  tour of these decaying areas especially the old factories 
I have the urban explorer fascination  However  the main reason I wanted to
post was to say to  Lumpy    the democrats have the unmidas touch   LMAO 
that is classic  and I must agree with Lumpy  Freaking hillarious and so
true  Thanks Lump man  BTW  great blog and great info  Peace

I  too checked out a few listings for under $1 000 and was absolutely shocked
at the property taxes  A $1 000 house  which could be fixed up into maybe a
$30 40 000 house comes with a tax bill of $4 6K per year! The taxes on my
$140K house in an urban area of Mississippi are only $1500 year 
Additionally  even if you paid cash for the house  you d probably want to
carry some homeowner s insurance with all the inherent risks to the property
 arson  vandalism   and I m sure it s sky high  given those risks 

Noshin  at the Tupelo Honey Cafe | Plus  how to get great service in
busy restaurants

By the time I got to Asheville  I was nearing the end of my journey and the
bottom of my wallet  The last thing on my mind was spending money  it was
beautiful outside  and there were free things to do everywhere 

But  When I d posted on Facebook that I was coming to town  no fewer than three people told me
I just had to visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe   So I checked their website  and instantly fell in
love 

 Tupelo Honey Café opened in downtown Asheville in 2000  an early pioneer in
the farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent
restaurant landscape that pervades the city  Our food is fresh  made from
scratch  sassy and scrumptious  Our cuisine salutes our love of Southern
traditions at the table  but like the good people of Asheville  marches to
its own drum  The result is a unique riff on Southern favorites   tupelohoneycafe com

I was convinced but I wasn t alone  On a sunny Sunday afternoon  the waiting list
was an hour long  After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash
 contents  10 saltines   I decided to go for it anyway 

By the time I finally got a seat at the counter  I was starved  It took me about
thirty seconds to pick out the Charleston Chicken Sandwich   grilled
marinated free range chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti  romaine
lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise   Free range? Cranberry? Havarti? Yes  I
could dig it 

While I waited for the food  I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo
Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares  preserves  pickles  salsa  honey 
t shirts  aprons and all sorts of mini advertisements for the restaurant 

I ve visited plenty of farm to fork restaurants  and this one may be the best
I ve seen at self marketing  There s nothing wrong with it  the food in those
jars is probably delicious  though I question whether the $10 tupelo honey had
to come from Florida or if it s produced locally 

Either way  it s nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be
incredibly busy  Some of that is surely due to good marketing  but the real
reason for its popularity is this 

That sandwich was so good  I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite
to savor it more completely  The potatoes were light and un greasy  the flavors
were perfectly balanced  the chicken was juicy and rich  and let s be honest
here  I m always happier eating dead animals when I know they ve lived a good
life  I found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious
contribution  Thank you  chicken  I will never forget you 

I stopped eating halfway through  not because I was full  I stopped so I could
take the rest home and taste it again later 


On another topic  I made a discovery there in the Tupelo Honey Cafe  one which
I d like to share with you now 

If you re going to a busy restaurant and want great service  bring a camera  Take
a few photos of the menu  the kitchen  the food 

No sooner had I taken the above photo  when a server  not even my server 
appeared at my elbow  Later when I stopped eating and lifted my napkin from my
lap  it took approximately three seconds for someone to take my food away to be
boxed up 

Now  I m not saying the service before my camera flash was bad  because it was
awesome  But wow  it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food
critic or travel writer 

Which  it just so happens  I am  But even if you re not  try this out sometime  I
can t guarantee it ll work  but I personally will do it againand probably back
it up with a stellar review  just like the one I ve given the Tupelo Honey
Cafe 

Everybody wins 

Okay  that s it! I could talk about Asheville for weeks  but it s time to move
on  Next stop  sunny Tennessee  where I get down on The Farm 


How soon is now? Lebron James Makes His Decision  The A Rod
Route
8 Jul 2010
by Rick

Lebron James is an extremely talented basketball player  He s also a very astute
individual who understands how to use the media    and various communication
channels    to his advantage  He s also managed to surround himself with people
who understand business  but I m starting to wonder if he s lost a bit of
understanding of American culture 
Lebron didn t play college basketball  he went straight from high school to the
pros  and since joining the Cleveland Cavaliers he s won exactly zero NBA
champions   He s a free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which
team he s going to play for in a very public manner  with a live announcement on
ESPN 
Earlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive
following  This morning he announced 

Lebron James was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as
well 
But I m starting to wonder if Lebron isn t painting himself into a corner  and
has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change 
Sure  Shaquille O Neal once said    I ve won
at every level but college and pro   but Shaq was always a larger than
life  literally  character who was outgoing and had a great relationship with
fans  That s one of the reasons 
Shaq s been a huge hit on Twitter   Lebron doesn t have that sort of
relationship with fans  I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex
Rodriguez  An incredibly talented player    perhaps the best in the game    who
went a very long time without winning a ring 
By making his announcement in this public way  Lebron has only heaped more
pressure on himself  Ask A Rod how the media can turn on you when you put
yourself above your teammates  above the game   James now finds himself in the
following position 
1  Winning a title is expected immediately wherever he goes
2  Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment
3  Winning a title will result in some saying that he couldn t do it alone
4  He s put himself in a position where if he leaves Cleveland  every other city
 and Cleveland  will be rooting against him
Sounds just like Alex Rodriguez  doesn t it? I m no longer the target demographic
for most of the products Lebron endorses  but you know what matters to me?
Winning championships  Not live prime time press conferences  not
self aggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the
playoffs 
Let s see what the future holds for Lebron  We know he ll be rich  but how will
he be viewed by fans across the country  Perhaps Lebron should have hired a 
Chief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors  If I
were to fulfill that role for him  I would have told him to go low key with this
decision and let it be led by his new team  Make sure it s clear that the team
comes first and that he s looking forward to being part of the team  That the
only thing that matters is winning a championship 
That that was the main factor 
Update  
Lebron chooses the Miami Heat and the similarities to A Rod continue 
with Dwyane Wade playing the role of Derek Jeter 
Update 2  And so it begins

Zombies and Vampires and Ninjas and Pirates
25 Jul 2010
by Rick
It s tough to kill the vampire   genre
I was noodling on Vampires the other day  but also lumped Zombies  Pirates and Ninjas
in the mix  These archetypes seem different to me than other  trends   Surely the
Vampire was dead after the spoof   Love at First Bite   in 1979  But then the Anne Rice  led revival brought it
back  technically the 1st  book  Interview with the
Vampire    was published in 1976  but didn t gain widespread popularity until
later   Then it jumped the shark with the Tom Cruise Brad Pitt movie  based on the Anne Rice novel  in 1994  But
bubbling below the surface was Blade and other genre flicks  then Twilight hit and now vampires are hot  
 Surely Ninjas were done with horrible movies like American Ninja  1985  or with
comedies starring Chris Farley   Beverly Hills Ninja   1997   and yet Ninja has become a replacement word for
 expert  to the point where it s almost accepted parlance  A twellow search for
 ninja  turned up more than 7 000 Twitter accounts using the term in their
profiles    Ninja Warrior is one of the
most popular shows on G4  
We can put Pirates away now after the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean flick  right? No  actually  if we ve learned
anything it s that genre memes just go back underground   Pirates for adults  NSFW You get
the point0  These characters are like Zombies  pun intended   they just keep coming
back to life 
So it s not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the Vampire merry go round 
it s knowing when  and where  to jump back on  If you jumped off Vampires would you
have known to jump back on in time to publish Twilight? Fourteen literary agents
rejected it before Stephenie Meyer got a deal   If you were off Zombies would you
have gotten back on it time to publish NY Times bestseller Pride & Prejudice and Zombies ? I don t think you can  get off  any
of these  you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular
culture  a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience  young adult   
Twilght  mature    True Blood  and sub genre  comedy  horror  sci fi     and then the
actual quality of the content  So what sort of matrix board do you have to create to
know that a NC 17 comedy horror Zombie video game will work  but a PG 13 young adult
time travelling Vampire TV show won t? You can t   All you can do is hope you bat
 300 and that when you fail  you fail
fast  
Ahh  the classics 
If you broaden your scope a bit  I think it would be difficult to find a time over
the last 40 years or so when any of these four archetypes didn t have a level of
bubbling popularity via books  comic books  tv  movies  video games  music  If all
you re looking at is 1 or 2 content categories maybe it looks like they re dead  but
they may be flourishing elsewhere  and like a virus they re just waiting for a new
host to carry them to the mainstream  Publishers  producers  editors  TV
execs  they all have to calibrate their decisions based on so many factors  and yet
even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors  A gut
instinct that something is going to work  Somebody at AMC is greenlighting The Walking Dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like
Zombies  but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new
twist that will bring new people into the  zombie and
AMC  tent   Personally  I m waiting for someone to make Pirate Zombies v  Ninja
Vampires  Hey  if they can make Aliens and Cowboys   anything is possible

I like twilight! I could sit and watch all day long if I didn t have school  or
life to stay me from doing it! lol Wonderful Simply Superb!

This is the first in a series of articles by guest blogger The
Apocalyptic Housewife  



Somewhere in California  a blighted  mosquito vector abandoned property is
about to get an echinacea dose via seedbomb 

Seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb hurling  the
balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess  and my own
forte  the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper 

It also requires a certain attitude  The first step to seedbombing is  1 
Understand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily 

You will fuck it up   Live with this  Embrace it  
Nothing worth
doing was learned perfectly the first time  If Mother Nature herself were
perfect  she wouldn t need us urban urchins to help cover her
scars with flowering seeds 

Here s where we started

2  Mix in seeds 

Use seeds of any kind  even dumpster salvaged ones  or the ones that might be too
old for the garden 

You can mix them with a 30 30 40 mix of potting soil  worm casings and clay  Or
you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at
that estate sale last year and get to mixing 


NOTE  Cover your work area  Dust can fly into your mouth and
eyes very easily  If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is  that
wouldn t be pretty  Use gloves to break up the soil with your
fingers 


3  Make bombs 

Form the mix into balls of any size from sling shot pellet up to softball 
You re going to be throwing them  Customize it yourself 

Mine were more or less matzoh ball size and shape  out of habit  This worked out
pretty well 

Allow to dry overnight  or until they re solid enough for the next
step 
4  Throw 

Today  I kept it simple  I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from
downtown  and two vacant lots  The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the
freeway offramps 


First lesson learned    you need at least two people to seedbomb from a
vehicle   The first responsibility should be driving safely  I found this
hard to do while also avoiding cops  dealing with the camera and the car window 
scoping out angles of approach for throwing  etc 

I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap  Also  a perfect
strike  But you ll have to take my word because a camera at that moment
would have been crazy 

Second Lesson    keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container  
You want both tidiness and easy access  Plus  those things are crumbly  I made
eight  the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag
for half an hour 

And the last lesson    have fun   It s play  Seedbombing is a
hit or miss way for change to take root  pun intended  It s chlorophyll
graffiti  No one I know is getting digg d or favrd yet for throwing color
and scent around the ghetto  Do it to see how it feels  You may want to keep
checking on your flowers  I promise I will  or you might get an idea to do
something else completely unexpected  I did  

Enzo Angolini spike heels found by serendipity at St Paul s Thrift for
$3 98  Sexy  non?


For example  make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully  plant  them
in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping
the dirt over them with your sole 

This is also good practice for looking lost and cluelessly invisible  More on that in
future posts 

5  Enjoy 


Earth is my friend  like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to
on Facebook 


When I took a victory lap and hand wash break in the mall  I was happy  not in a
smug superior way  but in the knowledge that I had avenged myself against the
whole Sunday at the mall culture that I felt smothered by  I did it by throwing
flowers all along those places no one goes  but where our planet s future
lives 

There is one over riding message to this    Quit being such a goddamned
perfectionist  Yes  yes  I know  you know of much better places
to never throw those seedbombs you haven t made  You could get better soil
if you put it on the shopping list  You undoubtedly write much better and could
have a real serious article with awesome non blurry pictures taken by a person
who actually can get the timer to work for a goddamn change  The actions that
you never do are absolutely perfectly effective  in your imagination 
But my actions accomplished something today 

Which brings us back to  1  A job worth doing is worth doing crappily 

This blog is the digital proof

Did this with my aunt in Griffith Park after the last bout of fires 
Didn t know there was a term for it  my mom and aunt have been seed
bombing for years  They ll be glad to know it is catching on among the
under 60 set 

Raggedy Anarchy 25  Nov  2009 at 5 46 pm

Thanks for commenting  Kate  Your mom and aunt sound great 

I used to see this old scary dude walking around checking the trees in
Griffith Park for Dutch Elm Disease  Turns out he had been a brilliant
biology student before losing derferment and going to Vietnam  Thanks for
making me remember him

Didn t know there was a name for this  Awesome idea though  My wife and
I did this when we lived in Texas     planted blue bonnets in a state
park  Yeah  I know   Texas has plenty of blue bonnets   you
say    

Well we thought they could use more 


Jessica Reeder 15  Dec  2009 at 9 08 am

Hey Brian  thanks for stopping by! That was nice of you  

There is no such thing as too many flowers  Well done 

We just made seedbombs for our holiday gift baskets  they re a mix of
flowers from the yard  heavy on the poppies 

I am not nice  young  hip  white  rich  educated  suburban or any of the other
things you are unconsciously assuming anyone who loves the earth must be  My
discontent is the mother of invention  and by invention  I mean creative
re purposing 

I love bringing apt quotations and poems to awkward occasions the way another
guest would bring a box of See s  Actually  I do that  too  Anyone who doesn t
have a sweet tooth is bound to have a mean streak  and freegan chocolates are
perfectly salvagable most of the time 


That s me  I m the Apocalyptic Housewife  I take pictures and have ideas and
enjoy my thoughts and try to do a little something less about consuming and more
about redemption every day  It makes me a little nicer

The Internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of
it 

I noted on Facebook that  from a statistical perspective  what makes baseball such an
amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see  on a daily basis 
something you’ve never seen before   It’s a truism  I know  but it has the benefit of actually
being true   In this case  the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel
Pagan hit an inside the park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game  John Emerson responded with some humbug about it
not being an inside the park grand slam  which made me remember that I had seen an inside the park grand slam at some time in the remote past 
I remember being six or seven years old and watching the Mets play the Cardinals in an
afternoon game at Shea Stadium  and thanks to the miracle of the Internet  I can definitively say that at approximately 4 30
p m  on 9 June 1985   I watched Terry Pendleton hit an inside the park grand slam off Joe
Sambito in a game the Cardinals would go on to win handily  The fact that I can verify vague
memories of events that occurred twenty five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget
the Internet is capable of doing 
This realization is obviously not of world historical importance  merely a reminder that this
thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to
human memory  The fact that at some point in the future I can know who I rode in an elevator
with on 28 December 2005 is less weird because I chose to write
about riding in an elevator with Grimace   That I can access detailed information about
events I have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely 


Joe Sambito  Wow  I d completely forgotten about him  I sometimes wish I could forget that
Pendelton is the Braves hitting coach  Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get
tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside the park slam 
 Posted by  Chuck | Wednesday  19 May 2010 at 06 16 PM 


He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets  stayed for  85  then he pitched for
the Red Sox against the Mets in  86 World Series  I remember him being ineffective  and as it
turns out  he was   Now that I remember him  which I didn t before  I remember him as
being the pitcher who d pitched for 1  the team the Mets faced to get to the  86 Series and 2 
the one they faced in it  I didn t remember that I remember that  but now that I do  I do 
Memory  as Gertrude Stein would say  is funny 
Posted by  SEK | Wednesday  19 May 2010 at 06 27 PM


Apparently the drug use  sexual excess  and weird UCI experiences haven t softened your
brain yet 

What s really bothersome  though  is when you only remember things from your distant
past  

My grandpa was alert till the end  but when I last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to
talk about was 70 years in the past 

Posted by  John Emerson | Wednesday  19 May 2010 at 07 02 PM


A guess  but perhaps your grandfather s life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70
yrs

You know what makes this post great? No stinking cricket 
 Posted by  tomemos | Wednesday  19 May 2010 at 09 04 PM 



Yeah  I remember Sambito from the Astros  when the Braves were in the old NL West because it
made sense to have a team 3 000 miles from most of their division rivals   Solid pitcher for a
while  But burned out toward the end  Apparently  he is a player s representative now

I like to read about others watching baseball more than I like to watch baseball by a factor
of nine  Having given up on watching the actual sport  mention of baseball now only sparks
memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers  It is true that at the
end of time  the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers  as they
had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing  but horrendous to watch in
person  Plus  they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes  

nota bene  An overdue library book is a crime against Humanities

Farming on Sand  The trouble with  eating local  on Cape Cod |
Uprooted  an eco travel blog

This is part 4 of a 4 part series on tourism s impact on Cape
Cod  Read about death 
& carnage in the shell shop   find out about the eco friendly 
food scene   look at the pretty pretty sunset   or continue on    

David DeWitt doesn t look like a farmer  With his long hair  scruffy beard and
t shirt  he d fit in more at a Phish show than behind a plow  But appearances
are deceiving  and David s comfy mien belies a passion that is influencing the
culture of northern Cape Cod 
To wit  in 2009  David helped launch the Truro Ag Fair
    an event that exceeded all expectations and brought
huge crowds to local farmers  booths  He runs the Rock Spray nursery  a
Certified Natural provider of evergreens and ornamentals  And he manages the
First Light Organic Farm  a lush green spot in a hollow of North Truro  Here 
David and his partner 
Arthur Teubner work year round growing heirloom and hardy fruits and
veggies to sell at market 
David s a dedicated and inspired agrarian  whose passion for farming keeps him
optimistic  But farming on the Outer Cape is the sort of Sisyphian challenge
that can wear anybody out 
The hard truth 
The soil of North Truro is not strong enough to support agriculture  Without
fertilization  it deteriorates shockingly fast 
David points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the
edge  Last season it was a fertile veggie bed    but it was left un fertilized
as an experiment 
 This is what happens   David says   You have to keep feeding it
organic material  or it turns back into sand  




This plot was a test run  left untended for a single
season  Last year s rich loam is now useless sand 

It s always been this way in North Truro  The Outer Cape is really just a spit of
sand    but still  farmers lived here for generations  How?
Salt marsh hay 
There used to be a local tradition in this area  at each spring tide   the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes
to harvest the grasses  This was called  salt marsh haying  
Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds  and it doesn t compact as heavily as other
types of hay  This makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost  and it
was used for generations as a soil enricher  But haying had to happen regularly 
says David 
 There s so much oxygen in this soil  any added compost gets burned up in six
weeks  All the nutrients get depleted  
That means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become    you
guessed it    sand 
The only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming
in  That means truckloads of hay  and that means a lot of work  Last year  David
and Arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch  It worked    but it
cost money  and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground  Not a long term
plan 
In bygone times  the whole town of North Truro would pitch in on haying days 
now  David s on his own  Without that community support  it s nearly impossible
for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green 
Meanwhile  in Tourist Town USA   
The Provincetown farmers market has lovely produce  but little of it was grown on
the Cape 
Provincetown s official population of 3 500
supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year  City
folk marvel at the quaint charms of the Cape  its idyllic beauty and simple
pleasures  And then they go out to eat 
Even if tourists were interested in sustainable food  they totally don t care    they d be hard pressed to find a locally sourced
meal  Raina Stefani serves David s produce at her restaurant Terra Luna   but it only makes up a
portion of her fares  the rest has to be shipped from the mainland  You can t
squeeze blood from a stone  and you can t get big vegetable crops from sand
dunes  End of story 
Well  not exactly 
David isn t giving up    in fact  he s got plans and ideas to refashion North
Truro s farming community  Hence the Ag Fair  and the ongoing experimentation
with varieties and soils at First Light  David isn t alone  he s got the support
 and companionship  of a growing group of gamechangers  If the young farmers and
foodies of Truro can organize  they might just be able to get local agriculture
back on its feet 
Their main opponent? The tourism and real estate industries  which insist upon
turning every arable inch of the Cape into somebody s backyard  The same
population that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its
production 
No surprise there  After all  what s the point of farming on the beach?

If  someone could start bedding the outer cape s horses  with this Hay Straw 
You know they could  It would be even better for the system  This would
also  make it more profitable  The horses  would be heathier  They wouldn t
have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time  The straw hay could
also be a form of supplemental food  for livestock horses  which has been
used in before times  The straw  should be separated from the manure and
dried in the air  then buised  by hooves  Then it is more ready  to be mixed
with the soil  in the spring 

Facebook Fans  You Get What You Pay For
24 Mar 2010
by Rick

Take a look at the Facebook Fan Pages of some brands and what you see is not a
pretty picture  Oh  the numbers look good  but when you dig a little deeper a
different picture emerges  Walls filled with off topic conversations at best 
vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst  What happened? Wasn t
having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing?
Well  yes and no  Sure  it s great having several hundred thousands fans  But how
did you come to get those fans? Did you earn them through fantastic customer
service  fulfilling the brand promise  providing value to the community in an
authentic and passionate voice  or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit
the broadcast airwaves with a promotion?
Let s look at   my old favorite   TGI Friday s 
 If you can see this  then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to
install Flash Player if it s missing  Get Flash Player
from Adobe  
Remember that ad? Pretty cool  right? In fact  as I recall  they got over 1
million Facebook fans  Google TGI Friday s Fan Woody and it looks pretty good 
But then something not so awesome happened  All those fans wanted their free
burgers and they wanted them now! TGI Friday s completely lost control of the
page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers  Now from a short term
perspective I m sure they did ok on the deal  People came in and ate their food 
But they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail  the newspaper or
by an email list  But they decided to go the Social Media route 
Now  let s take a look at what the Friday s FanWoody Facebook page looks like
today 
Whoops! It s gone 
Apparently Woody and his
900 000  fans went poof   How come? I m guessing it had something to do
with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather
than growing them  A TGI
Friday s Facebook page does exist  with roughly a third of the fans they
used to have  TGI Friday s pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on
their relationship with 600 000 people 
It s easy to pick on TGI Friday s but they certainly aren t the only guilty
party  I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads  The
ability to target your demo is really terrific  but you re in danger of creating
a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a  what have you done for
me lately  foundation 
First  you essentially bought these fans  You paid Facebook for the right to
target them  Then in the case of TGI Friday s or other brands that offer free
product or discount coupons  you are essentially buying them again  This sets up
a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with
a tangible item  that is  free stuff  That s not a bonus item  it s now a
standard part of the agreement  Want me as a fan? Give me free stuff 
The point of Social Media isn t to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to
engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons  often free   discounted product
is the least of these reasons  I m not saying that special bonuses  or  surprise
and delight  offers aren t ever a good thing  I think when used properly they
can be terrific  What do I mean by used properly? As a reward for people who
have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way  Send us a picture of you
wearing a brand t shirt and sure  you ve earned a free sandwich  Recruit some
friends and I m happy to give you all some coupons  But when fans enter the
relationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and you re in
trouble 




 Kathy Sharpe says  April 18  2010 at 1 02 pm

About time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans  Even if
you have 3 million  fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the
real marketing value?

Jet Lag  Pathophysiology and Cures
The longest Monday of my life
         
I recently returned to the US from Australia  The 14 hour flight took me from Monday morning in Sydney to Monday
morning  again  in L A  Crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking I
should be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the California sky 

You may be familiar with the concept  Jet lag  The catch all name for circadian misalignment  the disruption of sleep
cycles and circadian rhythms  If you ve had the pleasure of crossing time zones in a jet plane  whether it was a mere
three hour hop from one coast of the US to the other or a trip to another continent  chances are  you ve experienced
some amount of jet lag  

The pathophysiology of jet lag

Normally  two systems  the homeostatic system and the circadian system  work together to produce a 24 hour sleep
cycle  During the day  the homeostatic system slowly accumulates a  sleep drive   a desire to sleep that increases as a
function of time spent awake  The circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive 
which  during the day  keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy  An hour or two before bedtime  this signal
subsides  and s he realizes it s time to hit the pillow  The sleep drive dissipates as a person sleeps and by morning
 assuming a full night s rest and possibly some coffee   s he will be feeling alert and ready to go again 

Robert Sack wrote a delightful paper  PDF  on jet lag  by the way  which is
where I m getting much of my information  

So we ve got a nice cycle of sleep  Jet lag is what happens when the homeostatic and circadian processes are
misaligned  For example  the circadian system may signal a person to be alert when it s not actually morning  or may be
reduced during daytime hours  causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled
out  

But I don t want to be sleepy!

How do you beat jet lag? Robert Sack lists three primary approaches  


Reset the body clock
Prescribed sleep scheduling
Medication to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia



Let s start with the first one  as it turns out to be the most complicated  

Resetting the body clock

The two most effective ways to reset the body clock are 1  through bright light exposure  and 2  timed melatonin
administration  

Light is one of the most important cues about time of day and has the greatest effect on circadian timing  much
smaller effects are seen from regular activities and meals  for example   Studies have shown that without light cues 
totally blind people tend to have free running circadian
rhythms with an average period of 24 5 hours  instead of the usual 24  If a person is exposed to bright light early in
the day  the person s internal clock is reset to an earlier time  if exposure is instead in the evening  the internal
clock is reset to a later time  Brighter light has more of an effect  such as the sun  at 3000 to 10 000 lux   though
lower intensities  e g   100 550 lux  can produce changes 

Artificial light sources can be used to supplement daylight  to help reset a person s internal clock to the correct
new time zone when traveling  Alternatively  a person could wear very dark glasses  as light avoidance could help
minimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night  

Resetting the body clock  Part 2  Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone that has been linked to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles
 PDF   Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night  secretion is suppressed by light exposure  and as such  the
hormone can be thought of as a  darkness signal   If doses of melatonin are administered in the morning  circadian
rhythms will be shifted later  evening doses shift rhythms earlier  Timing of the doses is more important than amount
per dose  though it remains to be seen what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration is  trials have been
done with doses from 0 5 to 10mg  at times ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the
new time zone 

If doses of melatonin are combined with light exposure  the results are what you might expect  synergistic if both
are administered to produce a time shift in the same direction  both earlier or both later   antagonistic otherwise 

Sleep  wake  sleep  wake

The second way to beat jet lag  Sleep at weird times  Slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your
destination  or keep your home sleep schedule for a while after you arrive  The problem with this is that your
sleep wake schedule won t match up with that of the people around you  and if you need to be awake for breakfast at 7am
or for a meeting in the afternoon  your sleep schedule may interfere  Use this method at your own risk  

Drugs for everything

Lastly  we have sleep medicines  As you might guess  hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off
daytime sleepiness pretty well  because by definition  that s what they do  Both benzodiazepine and non benzodiazepine
drugs have been shown to be effective in the first case  for the latter  the most common solution is to consume more coffee  PDF   This works! In the study
linked  subjects were treated with slow release caffeine or with melatonin prior to a long eastward flight  the caffeine
subjects were less sleepy than either melatonin or placebo  Granted  caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep
later and awoke more frequently  but that may be a risk you have to take   

Lagging behind

Light  melatonin  drugs  strange sleep schedules  Of course  the only solution that will always work is time  The
homeostatic and circadian processes need to realign  and while the aforementioned ways of beating jet lag can fast track
the process  it still takes time  

UPDATE    I was alerted by a friend of the existence further research of which I was
unaware  Another way to reset your sleep wake cycle is to stop eating   If you fast for about 12 to 16 hours  your body clock will reset  with whatever time
you break your fast as morning  The  Fuller  Lu  & Saper paper
 PDF   published in Science   discusses the mechanism  though a more recent paper argues that the Fuller et al  results are inconclusive  
      
Save the World  Ride a Bike
a visit to Troy Bike Rescue

30  Sep  2009

This post is the first of a three part series on bike culture  Come back Friday to read about
anarchy 
bike jousting  and two wheeled social protest  

Remember when you got your first bike? Was it a Christmas present  or maybe a birthday gift?
Remember how much fun you used to have on that bike  how fast you went  how great it felt?
Well  these days  most kids want an Xbox for their birthday  their parents ride around in
cars with seatbelts  talking on their
phones   Cycling is a thing of the past  a sport  a hobby  but rarely a mode of
transportation  But I m here to tell you  riding your bike is still fun  and
still fast  and it s the cheapest and most socially responsible workout you ll ever
get  
And there are no two ways about it  if you give a kid a bike  that kid will ride 
In Troy  New York  I met one Andrew Lynn  He s somewhat of a man
brain
trust   and one of his best creations is the Troy Bike Rescue   It started in 2001  when Andrew
would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters  He started hosting work parties with
friends in his backyard  teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding 
Slowly but surely  the circle grew and Andrew s backyard parties became weekly workshops 
When Andrew decided to leave town for a few years  schooling in NYC  friends and cohorts took
over operations  By the time Andrew returned  Troy Bike Rescue  let s call it TBR  had a life
of its own  These days it s an established club  run by volunteers and donations  turning
trashed bikes into treasures  Its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront  a
sister shop in Albany   Albany Bicycle
Coalition    movie screenings and pro cycling political events  and a dedicated core crew
that keeps everything rolling 

TBR s customers run the gamut  from businessmen to street kids to college students to
families  The one thing they have in common? They get it 

This group understands the value of a bicycle  more than just transportation  a
bike is a statement against fossil fuels  More than a toy  it s an equalizer that allows poor
kids to ride with rich  More than a hobby  it s a way of traveling through the world that lets
you interact  use your muscles  breathe fresh air    all for the cost of a free dumpster
bike 


When I visited the TBR shop  it was packed with frames  wheels  gears  chains  handlebars 
kids  and anarchist art  the space is being donated by some supporters who are also
anti capitalist activists  
TBR hosts workshops twice a week  For a few hours  the doors are open to anyone who walks in 
Tools are available  and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge  Parts can be had for a
pittance  and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the
space 

The main focus of TBR  however  is not selling bikes  The idea is to give people a workspace
and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle  Self sufficiency is a major tenet of the bike
movement  and Troy Bike Rescue is training self reliant individuals of all stripes 
All around me  college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines  An older man
asked for tips on tuning his racer  A young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he
needed a new one  and  despite Andrew s stern reprimand that he couldn t just walk in every
week and leave with a free bike  he did just that  

A dad came in with his three kids  all of whom left with snazzy rides    but first  they all
sat down and worked on their new wheels together 
And as we left at the end of the workshop  a woman walked up to Andrew   I love what you do  
she said   I have a whole bunch of bikes to give you  
See  ultimately TBR is about more than just bicycles  It s about building community  and
triggering a quiet but inexorable social movement  This is not the world s first bike
collective  in fact it s only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around America  These
collectives are not waiting for change to happen  they re creating it through small  positive 
peaceful actions  You too can change the world  all you have to do is ride a
bike 
Try This at Home  Ride Around
Fall is here  which  in most places  means great riding weather  What are you waiting
for?
Bikes are cheap  you can get one at your local thrift store for $5 50  It doesn t have to be
perfect  just good enough to get you places  So pick one up  and ride it to the end of your
block! Then keep going!
Even if your life requires four wheels  you can use a bike for local errands  Ride it to the
corner store when you need milk  instead of driving across town to the grocery store   Don t
like the milk they sell? Tell the store owner what you like  and see if he ll carry it  Now
you re changing the world  
On weekends  instead of driving to the park  hop on your bike and go exploring  It doesn t
have to be a workout  you can just toodle around town and look at stuff  Or  if you re a gym
buff  trade a workout for a bike ride  Unless you live on a major highway  odds are you can
ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting 
On vacation  rent a bike instead of a scooter  or  God forbid  a Segway   It s cheaper  and
much better for the local flora&fauna 
Still not convinced? Then think of it this way  by riding your bike instead of driving your
car  you re reducing your consumption of fossil fuels  You can even calculate the money you
save on gas  and keep it in a jar for a rainy day 

Want to get involved? Bike clubs tend to be pretty anarchic  but if you look around your
community you ll find both bike riders and shop owners who ride for change  Can t find a bike
community? Start your own!

Eminent Domain Used To Usurp Wine Label Real Estate

 I was disappointed  though not surprised  to see that today a conjunctive
labeling law dictating that  Sonoma County  be placed on every label on wines
produced from grapes grown in Sonoma County was unanimously passed by the California Legislature   Pushed as an
effort to promote  Sonoma County  wines and a consumer education effort  the new
law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines
their own marketing efforts  Yet  the law does nothing to educate consumers 
Passed unanimously out of the California Assembly and Senate  AB 1798 now awaits
the Governor s signature  which it will surely obtain  According to Noreen
Evans  an Assembly sponsor of the bill  this new conjunctive labeling law
 requires that any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area  AVA  located
entirely within Sonoma County   – like Russian River Valley or Dry Creek Valley
  must also include the word  Sonoma County  on the label  starting in 2014 
There are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County  
The problem  of course  is that by placing the words  Sonoma
County  on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in  Russian River
Valley    Dry Creek Valley    Sonoma Valley  or any other AVA in
SonomaSonoma County  have any single distinguishing feature derived from the
fact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County   County 
consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle  There no
evidence that grapes grown in  
Assemblywoman Evans concludes   By improving consumer education on each bottle 
conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to
represent Sonoma around the world  
She s correct  Beginning in 2014   Sonoma County  will receive a tremendous boost
in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add
more wording to their labels—whether they think the words  Sonoma County  help
or hurt their marketing efforts 
Frankly  if I was making high end wine from the  Sonoma Valley    Sonoma
Mountain  or  Sonoma Coast  AVAs that depended in part on the quality
recognition that comes wtih these AVAs  I d be pissed that I m forced now to put
a place name on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the
wine behind my label and  in some cases  demonstrably lowered its perceived
quality 
Honore Comfort  Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and
an outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this      This
moment    marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations
to come  
Proponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a
similar law that demands  Napa Valley  be placed on all wines that are made from
grapes grown in that appellation  rather than simply using a sub appellation 
They point to the prestige that the  Napa Valley  designation carries  But this
prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands  Napa Valley   in addition
to simply  Rutherford   be placed on these wines  It has to do entirely with the
promotional effort that has gone into making  Napa Valley  a place associated
with great wines 
Such an association will not be made with  Sonoma County 
wines   ever  The vintners in Sonoma County simply can t make a case for
 Sonoma County  having any meaning or for a region as vast as  Sonoma
County  delivering any degree of quality to the grapes 
Why is it important for someone making  Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir  or  Sonoma
Valley Zinfandel  to help promote  Sonoma County   a designation that has no
ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot
Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel?
This is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate  and it s
very valuable real estate  for the sake of promoting something that is of little
use to private commercial interests  Ask yourself   If putting the words  Sonoma
County  on one s wines was such a great thing  why don t more vintners who make
 Dry Creek Valley    Russian River Valley    Alexander Valley  or  Sonoma
Valley  wines already put these words on their label? They legally could   if
they wanted to 

The new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent
of the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain
over the labels of hundreds of vintners

 Nick Perdiew said    I love it Tom  You found a way to tie this in nicely 
This is a case of over reaching government regulation  costing business
unnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations  It s just
unnecessary 
 It also is a  social promotion  in the sense that great Sonoma wines that
now are forced to use  Sonoma County  will be giving some of their
credibility to their lesser neighbors  Shades of wealth redistribution as
well      Ew  ew  ew

James McCann said    How many hundreds or thousands of labels will have to be
re submitted to the TTB between now and 2014?

John Kelly said        I d be pissed that I m forced now to put a place name
on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind
my label and  in some cases  demonstrably lowered its perceived quality   
 Exactly  Tom  And I am really pissed  And so is every other producer I have
discussed this issue with  I still don t know whose interests are being
served by this useless piece of crap legislation  I completely agree with
you when you state   Such an association will not be made with  Sonoma
County  wines   ever   Duh  
 I ve got real skin in this game  We are going to have to totally redesign
our front label to make room for  Sonoma County    and so far every mock up
is cluttered and decreases the impact of our brand  
 Our best option looks like we will go to  North Coast  or  California  for
our front label appellation  and discuss the grape source  vineyard name and
meaningful AVA on the back label  
 Who is going to compensate me for this? I estimate the value to be in six
figures  and we are a small winery  For a larger winery with a
better established brand the value is much higher  
 Eminent domain is exactly right   this is nothing less than governmental
 taking   The legislators who backed this should be ashamed  They should
also expect to lose my vote for them next election

JohnLopresti said    I put in 1  decades in trade coursework  and several
branches of the industry  I support the new labeling requirement  
 Sonoma county always was the sheep ranch joke in the era of Napa s
well deserved  early  global fame  Sonoma county now is as good or better
than those early Napa vintages  Together we have led the world into modern
viticulture  with the help of UC Davis  and in some pretty good company from
other regions  
 I suppose the new law is all Sacramento hype  But I think it will improve
northcoast revenue and dignity  I admit I have voted for the bill s
authoress  
 When I was a kid in a county called Solano  not too famous for wines or
AVAs  people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was 
where was Black Pt   people always were confused how the somewhat
neighboring counties had such similar names  Now after several decades in
Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness  for its
viticulture and other industries  
 The town of Sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from Solano
County to Sonoma County  The ambience in the town Sonoma is only an enclave 
it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village  and for its
viticultural traditions  But Sonoma county encompasses much more territory 
and other AVAs within the county are starkly different from the
characteristics of Sonoma valley and the town of Sonoma  
 Aint many people still overseeing vineyard blends  Vive la nouveau Sonoma
County

Nick Perdiew said in 
 to JohnLopresti    John  Good of you to comment and good to have dissent 
What do you make of the fact that vintners  already  are free to put Sonoma
County on any label they want? Govt  cannot mandate marketing effectiveness
anymore than it can mandate perception of quality  If it were effective 
wouldn t you already see it virtually everywhere? I admit  I don t see the
reasoning of your argument here  The issue of the costs to vintners is
non trivial too as you can see above  
 August 30  2010 at 02 04 PM 


Bill Cadman said    Tom   I wonder what the response would be in Napa and
Sonoma if the vintners in Fresno convinced the state government to require
 California  be put on all labels of wine made within California? 
 August 31  2010 at 10 40 AM 


JohnLopresti said    These past few years   eminent domain  has become a
libertarian property rights flashpoint  since the Kelo v New London  CT 
case concerning urban renewal polemics  I can see Tom W s concerns  too  
 There was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted
in a company s revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened
requirements for 75% in county fruit in order to remain legal in designating
the wine as from  Napa   One rambling article s author counted 16
occurrences of the word Napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget
wine producer s 2005 Napa cabernet sauvignon

fredric koeppel said    what business is it of State government what
terminology goes on wine labels? those concerns belong to the federal govt
and the TTB  which already mandates  in fairly exhaustive detail  what goes
on front and back labels  and how can the state legislature single out two
counties  first Napa  now Sonoma  for this treatment? are they going to go
through the wine producing counties one by one?

 re at Fredric K s BTYH website there is a review discussing MacRostie pinot
noir  I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville
highlands  thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in
the uplands  Then  at Steve s site there is an interesting discussion of his
current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast  It s
easy to get lost in nomenclatures  when one is striving for new concepts  
 In a way  all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance  plus
the historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal
regions  Napa county and Sonoma county  Winkler heat summation datapoints
also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic
underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders
in premium winegrape production  There are many reasons why the new labeling
requirement makes sense from all these perspectives

El Jefe said    OK  so here s the real requirement  
  Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada 
that is located entirely within yada yada  shall bear the designation
 Sonoma County  on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters
on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on
containers of 187 milliliters or less   
 If I recall correctly  this is almost exactly the same as the requirement
for the government warning type size  
 So the answer seems pretty clear to me  just add  Sonoma County  to the
government warning

Johnonwine said     They  Honore Comfort and the Sonoma County Vintners

 Tom  I would suggest that all Napa wineries  good and bad  benefit from
having Napa Valley on the label  it is indeed a great example of marketing  
what you describe as promotional effort  
 Perhaps the proponents of the law are not doing the job they were hired to
do  perhaps the SCV needs a more passionate communicator on their marketing
team  putting together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible  
 Sonoma County  with roughly half of the wineries of Napa County  wins
roughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine
competitions  That  the fact that their wines cost less on average  and the
wineries are friendlier  less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the
public  
 Heck  if folks knew all that  maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with
 Sonoma County  on the label  
 You suggest that this is a bad law  that Sonoma County will never be
associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is  I disagree  but
I am eternally hopeful  optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will
inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in
their marketing communications  I have confidence they will change  retool 
improve  live up to their responsibilities  
 I worked selling and marketing Sonoma County wines  I won awards for my
marketing efforts  The story is simple  People are receptive to it  Selling
the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy  
 That s my take anyway  I don t aim to be contrarian  but I don t mind being
the sole supporter of the law   as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy

Varsity athletics  Credit or no?

         
It s a matter of balance
         
Vassar s varsity athletes may soon receive academic credit for participating in
their sports during the school year   This proposal has been in the works for nearly two years  and at long last 
folks are voting to approve it  Or to not approve it  but the former seems more likely 

As a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee and as a long time varsity athlete  you might say I have
particular stake in the proposal  After all  I could get half a unit a semester for up to four semesters  a typical
class is worth one unit  and a typical physical education course of any level is worth half a unit  with a maximum of
two physical education units counting toward graduation requirements  It seems justified  Students can receive credit
for participating in other extracurricular  faculty supervised activities  such as the orchestra  the choir  and the
repertory dance theatre  so why not varsity athletics?

My friend over at Carolyn Blogs agrees  from the above standpoint  sure  it seems fair to give credit to
students   If you get credit for introductory P E  classes  you should get credit for varsity athletics  But our
school newspaper presents other arguments in favor  which Carolyn thinks are highly unjustified 

On top of everything  we must remember that varsity athletics present a considerable time commitment  It is rare to
find another activity on campus—academic or extracurricular—that includes a comparable daily rigor and frequent
overnight obligation  Varsity athletes regularly travel throughout the northeastern to participate in meets  games and
tournaments  often gone from campus for an entire weekend at a time   

And you know what? Although it s certainly frustrating to travel to Boston for an all day competition on the same
weekend as a good friend s birthday party  a fascinating sounding lecture  a dance party  and seventeen other campus
events no one in their right mind would ever want to miss  I agree with Carolyn  The reason I participate in my sport is
because I enjoy it  If I cared more about other activities  I d do those instead  Simply being a huge time commitment is
not a valid reason for awarding credit  Carolyn s supporting example  that higher level courses with more difficult and
plentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory 100 level courses  drives this point home  And
she s backed up by our school s system of awarding units
instead of credit hours  

This system—which in its most basic form allots one unit of credit per semester course  regardless of difficulty 
hours in class and subject matter—makes Vassar relatively unique in its credit system 

According to Registrar Dan Giannini  “The rationale behind such a system is to try to send the message that all
courses are equal in worth and that one shouldn’t try to distinguish between courses based on time spent in or out of
class ”

The reason time commitment is highlighted is because  according to the authors of the article  the faculty  must
consider what it can do to mitigate possible academic pressures on these students   Um  No  I don t think the faculty
has any obligation whatsoever  Students choose to be varsity athletes of their own accord  If they can t manage to
balance their athletics and their coursework  then perhaps they should reconsider participating in a varsity sport in
the first place  Athletes shouldn t get special privileges simply because they re athletes 

Personally  I like the fact that even though I dedicate huge chunks of time to my sport  more time than
I dedicate to any single course  at least while in season   I can still keep up with my classmates who are taking
comparable course loads  minus the sport  Sacrifices must be made  sure  Dance party on Friday night  or overnight
travel to a competition? 

The question is  what s more important to me?

You learn stuff  too

The article continues 

 While athletes will continue to be held to the College’s rigorous academic standards  the athletics credit could
discourage a varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic credits while in their athletic season 

With the proposed varsity credit  the athlete seeking to assume five courses in his or her athletic season will be
checked with an overload form  thus encouraging the student to think twice about assuming such a large academic and
extracurricular load 

I d like to be known that students who have trouble balancing tough course loads and time consuming extracurriculars
have always had the option of taking a lighter load or dropping an extracurricular  Adding the option of a
varsity unit to the list doesn t make much of a difference  Students who aren t varsity athletes could add an easy P E 
course instead  Students who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so  And let it be known  varsity
athletes don t have to take a half unit for their sport    thus negating the need for an overload form if
taking five courses  

Carolyn says  in response to the above quote  that  participating in sports is optional  and should always take
second place to academics   True  mostly  Academics are officially what college is about  Academics are what get graded 
Students  GPAs will  in part  determine what they are able to do with their lives  But academics are only one particular
kind of knowledge  Carolyn s statement assumes that a student can learn more important things from academics than from
participation on a sports team  Personally  though  some of the most important things I ve learned about persistence 
goal setting  success and excellence  effort  teamwork  leadership     these I ve learned from my sport and my coaches 
It s a different kind of knowledge than what one typically gains in an academic course  yes  But it s no less important 
And that  I think  is the best reason for awarding credit for varsity athletics 

H R  5034  The Lies  The Facts  The Fictions


With so much at stake for America s alcohol wholesalers and their protected
monopoly status that props up unearned profits  it s no surprise they would
swing for the fences with all their state granted political power and
attempt to pass H R 
5034   This bill  currently in Congress  would give wholesaler
lobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine  lead
to the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol  kill
jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine  beer and
spirits  punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the
consumers that wholesalers won t and override the critical Constitutional
principle of a single American economic union   all for the sake of
protecting wholesaler profits by giving them unprecedented control and
influence over the entire American alcohol industry 
But what is truly remarkable  and likely a result of the wholesalers  hubris
stemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare  is their
willingness to misrepresent facts  ignore the truth  and mislead in their
defense of H R  5034 
The recently launched www hr5034 org
website is the creation of the National Beer Wholesalers Association and and
appears to be the repository all the misrepresentation  ignorance and
misleading ideas supporters of H R  5034 could possibly muster 
For the sake of context and setting the record straight  this post address
many of the misrepresentations and misleading claims made at the middlemen s
disingenuous new website 
On their homepage   http   www hr5034 org   

 Today’s system balances competition with public safety to
ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative
effects of an unregulated marketplace 


Is there really any competition when the state based
regulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of
alcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market  meaning that
without use of a wholesaler a producer cannot enter a state s market? It
also means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink  not
consumers 


 Unfortunately the effective state based regulatory system in
the U S  is under attack  Over the past 10 years more than 25 states
have faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate
alcohol and their ability to maintain a licensed system of alcohol
controls  
The only challenges to the state based alcohol regulatory
system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for
protectionist reasons  Even in the wake of successful suits that
challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed 
the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust
system of alcohol controls 

ON THE  LEARN MORE  PAGE   http   www hr5034 org learn more    Litigation
against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for
their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol
regulators  state attorneys general  public health advocates and many
others  When the economic interests of producers 
retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of
wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the
state than any other industry in america  you might expect them to fight
back  As for those that have  concern   let s recall that it s only a
tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators  that there is no formal
support from state attorneys general  only a mere handful of public
health advocates  a selection of recipients of campaign contributions
from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support H R 
5034  

 According to a recent national poll conducted by the Center
for Alcohol Policy  79% of respondents support the right of individual
states to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of
alcohol and 87% agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol
regulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens  not by
judges  
I m shocked  shocked i say  that the  center for alcohol
policy  is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that
it would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded
the poll  Does it get any more illegitimate?

On the  Fact v  Fiction page   http   www hr5034 org fact vs fiction    FACT  This
bill does not address direct shipping or any specific state alcohol law 
It does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping  It does not
mandate a direct shipping law where there currently is not one  The bill
does PROTECT a state’s wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it
in court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of
validity granted other state alcohol laws  Disingenuous in the extreme  And what s worse  the wholesalers knew
this when they wrote this  H R  5034 gives states the ability to pass
laws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against
out of state wine shippers  And we know such laws would be introduced
into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws
have been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years  In
fact  H R  5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers
receipt of a wine by in state shippers legal while making receipt of a
wine by out of state shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape 
home invasion or selling cocaine to children   Fact 
Protection of a state’s power to regulate alcohol is not an “industry
food fight ”  food fight  may be the wrong word 
Better to call the introduction of H R  5034 what it is  an attack on
the entire alcohol industry and consumers for the sake of protecting
wholesaler profits  It s no coincidence that brewers large and small 
wineries  spirit producers and importers  retailers  wine education
organizations  wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose
H R  5034 


 This bill does not amend or alter the Federal Alcohol
Administration Act  FAA Act  which provides federal guidelines in many
of these areas 
No it doesn t  amend  the faa act  It overrides it entirely 
To quote from H R  5034 
 not withstanding that the state or territorial law
may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress  the state law
shall be upheld    
This claim by the wholesalers that H R  5034  does not
amend  federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up
misrepresentation  It s like saying  i didn t kick the dog  but rather
his ribs fell on to my boot  


 It is the intent of this language to make clear the
congressional support for the holding in Granholm prohibiting state laws
that allow an in state winery to do something a similarly situated
out of state winery cannot do  Language that bars facial discrimination
is included in the bill to codify this prohibition 
I have great faith in the wholesalers  ability to mislead 
But this goes beyond even my expectation  The intent of H R  5034 is
precisely to overturn the granholm v  Heald supreme court decision that
did away with protectionist state alcohol laws  More importantly  the
very language of H R  5034 gives states the explicit right to
discriminate against out of state wine shippers  All the state needs to
do is offer the feeblest of justifications  Read for yourself   state or
territorial regulations may not facially discriminate  without
justification  against out of state producers of alcoholic beverages in
favor of in state producers   one of those  justifications   the bill
states  is maintenance of the  structure of the state alcoholic beverage
distribution system   in other words  discrimination is ok as long as
the discrimination is written into the state s alcohol beverage
distribution laws  Furthermore  note that wine retailers are not even
covered by this duplicitous language on  justification   The state needs
no justification to discriminate against out of state retailers  


 Over half the states have been sued challenging their
alcohol laws  The lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense
safeguards that require a face to face transaction  needed for I D 
checks  to buy alcohol 
In fact  face to face transactions are not needed for I D
checks  We know this because states have written laws that have gone
unchallenged that require I D  Checks to be made at the point of
delivery of the wine  


 Unelected judges should not set alcohol policy  this
responsibility rightly rests with individual state legislatures  as
guaranteed under the 21st Amendment to the U S  Constitution  
Judges never have set policy  State legislatures always
have  This is the big lie the wholesalers tell  Judges merely tell the
state when they have reached beyond what the 21st Amendment allows 
After that  the state legislatures  in every state where litigation has
affected badly crafted laws  went about legislating a fix  Surely the
wholesalers don t mean to say that state alcohol laws should in no way
be required to abide by the principles in the u S  Constitution  What
next  will the wholesalers argue the 21st amendment give the states the
right to prohibit women from buying alcohol? Will they argue that state
laws banning African Americans from being distributors is legal under
the 21st Amendment?


 State laws that raise concerns can and should be addressed
in the state legislature  
Lucky for Americans it wasn t this attitude that ruled the
day when jim crow laws were in place  The wholesalers would have argued
that the racist  separate but equal  philosophy had no business being
litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the
racist laws to overturn them with new laws  We have courts precisely to
adjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state
laws  But of course  wholesalers know this  They to have brought states
to court over alcohol distribution laws they didn t think were fair or
constitutional  It appears that wholesalers don t like the courts
involved when the decision don t go their way 

The hypocrisy  misleading notions and disinformation being featured at the
wholesalers website supporting H R  5034 is staggering  However  they do the
right thing when they invite readers to sign up for emails that will deliver
 the latest developments   I urge all readers to sign up for those emails  
In the mean time  please checkout the website that spurred the wholesalers to
launch their own  http   www stophr5034 org  It is published by the
Specialty Wine Retailers Association and upon reading through it  you should
find yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through

r said    Wow! I am speechless  I will not even waste my
time rebutting you point by point because you do not have a clue in many
instances what you are talking about  You do have a few valid points but
they too may be predicated on false premise  I do not claim to be the
all knowing expert  By using the same sensational BS Tactics you rail
against  instead of a balanced and fair assessment you render the
entirety of your rant incredible  In short the wine has to go from point
A to B in some way  Do you work for FedEx? It sounds like you would
prefer you government welfare to go there instead? Wholesalers compete
against each other    perhaps you forgot  They do not operate
monopolies  In Oregon for instance there are about 60 wholesalers
competing for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side 
hardly the ideal monopoly situation  In most cases where state laws
allow shipping you can get a bottle of wine shipped from the winery of
your choice  A very important point to remember  While large  commercial
wineries   Factory wine producers  may have the ability to market their
own wine  smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not
have the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many
cases  let alone having their own transportation infrastructure  They
are experts at farming and producing wine  which is what they likely
prefer to do in most cases   July 27  2010 at 09 08 PM

Effing Idiot


Go to 2 50 and listen as the audience laughs and laughs at O Donnell s stupidity

I heard this same accusation on Kos today  that the audience is laughing AT Christine
O Donnell on the first thing she says  but I disagree entirely  On THAT point  HER supporters
are laughing at COONS  it s absolutely a  She s got YOU  DUMBASS!!  laugh  the sort of
 Oh No She D I INT!  laugh you d hear from a studio audience when the slightly stupid but
affable and hitherto ineffective Dunce Character finally gets a zinger in on the Handsome
Lead 

Remember that at least half the audience in a venue like this would be there to support
O Donnell  and the  Point to  Separation of Church and State  in the Constitution  dig
is a virulently popular meme in the loonosphere from whence comes the Teabagger Political
Playbook  Those are hoots and calls of SUPPORT for O Donnell supposedly putting one over on
Coons  they aren t laughing at her  

There may very well have been a gasp  and some uncomfortable  Okay  that s enough now 
chuckles at the end  but the guffaws at the top of the clip are WITH her  not AT her

Hilarious 
Posted by  adx at October 19  2010 3 00 PM


I don t think the audience is laughing at Coons  the laughter has an incredulous  oh my god
sound to it  But it s obvious that O Donnell thinks they re laughing at him  not her  When she
hears the reaction  she looks out at the audience with a big  proud grin  She thinks she just
scored mucho points on Baldy 

Elding is right   separation of church and state isn t in the Constitution  is a major
wingnut talking point  They routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause doesn t
mean what everyone else thinks it means  So although this shows what an extremist nut
O Donnell is  it s not really a gaffe  it s standard stuff right out of their playbook 
Posted by  Steve8489 at October 19  2010 3 04 PM


Well  if one is looking for the phrase   Separation of Church and State   yeah 
that s not in there  so TADA! Yay! Looks at me  I wins a big arguments and I poops my pants 
But the principle is in there  I love when ignorant fucks like O Donnell and her little
orcling hordes make huge category mistakes like this  It s is akin to taking a tour of a
college and starting it off at the administration offices and when that part of the tour is
finished  someone like O Donnell says   Ok  that s great  but when are we gonna start seeing
the college? 

Posted by  at October 19  2010 3 10 PM



Yes  it s standard stuff  and HER CROWD would have springboarded OFF of it  that s what I m
saying  As far as she s concerned  it s not a gaffe  and as far as HER SUPPORTERS in the room
are concerned  it was not only NOT a gaffe  it was a Direct Hit  They should have applauded 
that would have settled this matter for good  I m convinced that s not laughing at her  that s
 Ooo  good one!  FOR her  
Posted by  ELDING at October 19  2010 3 11 PM


Well ELDING  its already being reported that it was HER that was clueless so Coons gets the
last laugh on that  
Posted by  Allonfla at October 19  2010 3 30 PM


I don t believe this was a public event  Elvis  I think it was a debate before the students
at the law school  I mean  it could be some of her supporters infiltrated  but I truly believe
there would ve been lots of catcalling  etc  if that were the case 
Posted by  pea at October 19  2010 3 30 PM


Yeah  Pea  you have a point there  but still  The laughter doesn t sound incredulous to me 
it sounds appreciative and snarky  Put yourself in a non partisan Law School Student position 
Would you laugh at loud at a Teabagger Meme like the one she dropped  or would you
mutter grumble to yourself  whispering to your colleague   What a fucking idiot!  I don t see
a crowd like that laughing out loud at such a pitiful little meme  it s not even worth a
laugh out loud guffaw  
Posted by  ELDING at October 19  2010 3 53 PM


well  keep in mind that all of them probably know what a freak she is  I think it might be
more of a  holy crap  I can t believe she just topped all the other stupid shit she s said 
and I got to bear witness to it!  laughter  I know if I had the opportunity to attend a Sarah
Palin rally  I d be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth 
Posted by  pea at October 19  2010 4 07 PM


which would be  uh  ANY Sarah Palin rally  Also

ELDING      

the debate was at a LAW SCHOOL  You really think lawyers are going to laugh at Coons rather
than O Donnell???

Not a snowballs chance in hell 
Posted by  Nicole473 at October 19  2010 5 00 PM


Excerpts from http   tinyurl com 26ddbvd

  You actually audibly heard the crowd gasp   Widener University political scientist Wesley
Leckrone said after the debate  adding that it raised questions about O Donnell s grasp of the
Constitution 

Erin Daly  a Widener professor who specializes in constitutional law  said that while there
are questions about what counts as government promotion of religion  there is little debate
over whether the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from making laws
establishing religion 

 She seemed genuinely surprised that the principle of separation of church and state derives
from the First Amendment  and I think to many of us in the law school that was a surprise  
Daly said   It s one thing to not know the 17th Amendment or some of the others  but most
Americans do know the basics of the First Amendment  

O Donnell didn t respond to reporters who asked her to clarify her views after the
debate  
Posted by  Big_Ben at October 19  2010 5 48 PM



Anyone who says  Evolution is only a THEORY   it s not a fact  is so stupid  so utterly
fucking brainless  uneducated  ignorant  clueless and unread they should immediately be
sterilized on the slim chance that there s a genetic component to their imbecility 
Anyone who stubbornly knows so little about science cannot possibly be expected to develop the
analytical skills necessary to interpret Con Law 
Posted by  cousinavi at October 19  2010 5 50 PM


If the laughter was with her  then the joke is on everyone there in support  of course 
because moments later  after she s basically pounding the desk talking about the constitution
and her unyielding devotion to that which does not separate church and state ha ha   she can t
recall the 14th and 16th amendments and needs to be refreshed by the questioner 

That s the real  busted!  moment here  if you ask me 

For people who speak so militantly about adhering to the constitution  I expect a military
like response to such a simple question 

Wingnuts will turn blue arguing about a Christian nation and constitution  but not knowing
two amendments  as a person running to uphold and defend the constitution containing those
amendments  this clip exposes her and the Tea Party faithful as constitutional frauds 

Not knowing what the constitution says when asked is bold font black over white  There s no
grey area  here 

As a defender  you can say   well  she believes church and state are indivisible  so do I  
But you can t say she knows the constitution when she clearly does not  

As someone trying to get a government job with great benefits where the qualification is
basically   take this constitution and defend it with your life   Tea Party Republicans spend
an awful lot of time tearing it up and reassembling the pieces to their acquired tastes  

Her argument dismissing the separation of church and state is dessert before dinner 

Slightly off topic  I ve been spending a lot of time on potential swing vote forums adding
fact to fiction  It s hilarious when republicans who voted for Bush twice and approved the
majority of the way through approval among republicans was pretty consistent are telling me
about all the mistakes Obama makes and imparting their Bush loving  wisdom  to those less
in the know 

If you think Bush was good enough to vote for twice  and you re one of the 60 million
McCain Palin people  your qualifications and insight  like Christine O Donnell s  are comical
at best 

Make no mistake  I m laughing AT you  Tea Party Republican people

I have to agree with Pea and Nicole   you can clearly hear a man s voice say  Oh my god 
after O Donnell says that and his tone is  I can t believe she said something so incredibly
stupid   Yeah  they were laughing at her  as is appropriate 

Posted by  Irish Girl at October 19  2010 5 53 PM


It s beyond frustrating to me  as someone who has studied Constitutional Law  who competed on
the the national level on it in law school  and who published an article on it  to hear people
who clearly haven t done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than I do what
the Constitution says  means  and is all about  

I had a TPer over at HuffPo tell me I didn t know what I was talking about vis à vis the need
for Constitutional interpretation and Constitutional Law  he believed that any and all
Constitutional questions must and can only be resolved by Amendment   not
by judicial review   before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and
 despise d  the legal profession   

Where do you go from there?
Posted by  GrafZeppelin127 at October 19  2010 6 41 PM


I thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the Constitution  and by that I mean they
regard it the same way as they regard the Holy Bible  It s a document that is not to be
questioned  but merely followed to the letter because it was handed down to us by greater
beings  Oh  and like the Holy Bible  that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or
interpret  they ll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with
what it actually says 

They try to exert some sort of control over it s meaning by elevating it to a level that
makes it untouchable  To them it s not a living document that was designed to change with the
nation  but essentially carved in stone like the Ten Commandments  Immutable and unchanging 
Except for  you know  maybe an amendment barring gay marriage  But in order to regain some
control over their lives that they firmly believe they ve lost  they re now trying to
determine  with unwavering certainty  that we ve all been doing this wrong the whole time and
if we just get back to what the founders wanted  everything will be ok 

Give  em a few minutes  though  They re waiting on an email reply from the Washington
re enacter at Arlington to hand down some decisions

@GrafZeppellin127

In answer to your question    where do you go from there? I ve recently come to the
conclusion that the answer is  nowhere   I used to be against making blanket statements about
the hard core tea partiers  like the person you described    they re not all crazy   they re
not all hateful  but lately  i m over it  

 they don t believe in  evolution  climate change  the dept of education  public education 
taxes in order to pay for roads police and firemen  they believe the President is not an
American  they see no problem with racism  sexism and fascism  they don t understand that
 freedom of speech  doesn t mean freedom from consequences  they confuse losing an election
with tyranny  they horde food because glenn beck told them so    they conflate their  movement 
with the civil rights movement   they  detain  reporters  on public property  for the crime of
asking questions   

you don t reason with people who believe these things  any more than you d try to reason with
charles manson  they re crazy    plain and simple and it s really  really sad 
Posted by  mslarry1973 at October 19  2010 7 23 PM


@ ELDING   Have to disagree  buddy  The debate was at Widener Law School  They laughed at her
the second time as well when she incredulously asked  as if not believing Coons   That s in the
First Amendment? 

I don t think they were laughing at him  If they were  they d be reacting after his comment
 and probably booing and calling him a liar  rather than reacting after her comment

You know she had better watch out! The separation between church and state is what saves us

sympathizers that are sneaking SHARIA LAW in on us!
Posted by  Ron Spridgen at October 19  2010 8 17 PM


Nah  I m convinced that the audible gasps and stifled chuckles were from her attempt to bluff
her way through an exchange regarding the Constitution in a room full of lawyers  

Performance art  people 

She s not running to win  and if you think she is  you re not paying attention 
Posted by  Lexaburn at October 19  2010 10 58 PM

Think of those Bill Maher clips  The constant television appearances for the last decade or
so  Think of who endorsed her  and how O Donnell could teach her a thing or two
about   moderate ad libbing 

The strategy is this  be as foolish as possible  so no one anticipates you actually knowing
anything  Embrace the derision and or ridicule  Go on the circuit as a passionate advocate for
whatever cause you choose to co opt  In O Donnell s case it s the same pseudo Christianity
holy rollers dignify to play within the political arena  In Palin s case  it s the
crypto fascism that oozes within the GOP  The Teapublicans fool no one with their talk of
independence and the theatrical in fighting  They always tame those they let in their ranks or
they destroy them  Palin knows her place  as do they all 

Do you really think a serious candidate would go around asking for hints during a debate?
Seriously! O Donnell is not that stupid  I know some of you want to think she is for the sake
of mirth and merriment  but she ain t  Sorry  Just like Palin isn t stupid enough to confuse
PA with WV  Poke fun all you want  but at least be realistic with yourselves  you have just as
much fun as they re having  

Trust me  y all  they are faking it!

O Donnell s running on personality alone  nothing more  nothing less  Regarding politics 
she s a glorified booster  same as with Mangle in Nevada  Lowden the chicken lady and Mangle
were merely supposed to challenge and beat Reid  then get out of the way  O Donnell is to be a
face for the underdog teabaggers  This is why they re not making a full investment in her  Her
place is not in the senate  but on television 
Posted by  Lexaburn at October 19  2010 11 17 PM


Elvis  having watching the video several times  I have to disagree  The audience was clearly
laughing at her and her ignorance  However  she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge
win and that the audience was on her side 

Just more of her complete separation from reality 
Posted by  DC at October 19  2010 11 23 PM


Oh  and ELDING  their reaction stems from the fact that she broached the subject again after
the moderator moved on  Her question was the equivalent of asking  Where re the pictures? 
when staring at the document  especially in that setting 

She did it on purpose  not to further the discussion  but to establish that  yes  she is a
dependable dumbass 

I m telling you all  she s running a game 
Posted by  Lexaburn at October 19  2010 11 24 PM


Lexaburn  I have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that she s not
that dumb  I don t believe she s as dumb as she is ignorant  It if really is a game for
O Donnell  then what s the end game? She may have flown under the radar for her previous
campaigns  but now she s made herself a fool in the national spotlight and effectively ruined
any chance of continuing her charade  if her intention was to be a lifelong nominee in the
first place 

Being a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far  and if they don t intend to win after
getting the nomination  then that con game is limited 

Maybe Palin fits more into the realm of your assessment  but if she runs and loses in 2012 
her shelf life is limited too

@Nicole  hi! It s good to be back  I ve been awol due to having a baby    little Liam was

Posted by  Irish Girl at October 20  2010 1 08 AM

BC  you misunderstand me  I m not saying she knows a damned thing about the Constitution  In
fact  I d go a far as to say she doesn t give one damn about it  What I m saying is that going
into these discussions  she s fully aware of her deficiencies  To tell the truth  I can t tell
you her actual  endgame   per se  but if I had a guess it would be an extended stint on a
cable news channel 

The  shelf life  of both women is only limited to the fraction with which they uphold a
standard  Palin took standards out of the equation when she quit her job  Were she to actually
run  it would be for vanity s sake  She s reaching for what O Donnell has already achieved 
They ve both lowered themselves to being cheerleaders for so called  conservative  causes 
Well  Palin did anyway 

I attribute part of my assessment of O Donnell to info I ve gleaned from a good friend of
mine that knew her on the media circuit at the start of the decade  My friend describes her as
a  bad actress  primarily  that co opts  conservativism   but doesn t necessarily cling to it
as some may believe  This friend tells me that Christine doesn t believe half provocative
and or boneheaded things she s saying  O Donnell is described as a normal conservative
Republican woman by my friend  I am convinced personally that O Donnell s just a starved media
personality that found a new gimmick in running for public office  That is the lifestyle
choice she has made  and she s sticking with it  Some of the innuendo surrounding her leads me
to this conclusion  as well  However  I can t be too conclusive   

You know what  I m being too much of a stuffy doctor 

Anyway  that smile she gives after asking about the 1st Amendment may very well be her being
in on the joke she s making of herself  It s not the fact that she tried and failed to dictate
content within a Constitutional Amendment  it s the fact that she knew she did not know and
said what she said regardless  Do not try to make sense out of anything of this if you re not
thinking like a   celebrity of whatever quality  let s say 

Here s what you do  gather all the O Donnell appearances that you can from online sources 
Go through all  and see if her point of view EVER evolves beyond the con servative blather or
the crank conspiracy theories  Next  ask yourself why she continues to be invited to these
public forums  What exactly is she adding to these conversations? In all my cable news
watching  I ve seen far more dim characters than O Donnell with regular gigs  so it s not the
fact that she s dumb that gets her on television  My friend tells me of certain connections
individuals like O Donnell have that gets them the leeway they need to raise their public
profile  Since they really have no one to answer to  they can go on television and say
anything  get away with it  and do it again in yet another televised venue  It s a perpetual
cycle  She s not campaigning to win anything  I m telling you  BC  

You see how Rove immediately rejected her  I don t believe that was because she beat the
 establishment  candidate  In fact  my theory is that Rove wasn t so much as rejecting her  as
limiting her role within the media environment  I m thinking she s aiming to be on FNC on a
regular basis  This all comes from my observing her debate performances  as well as her more
recent TV appearances  She s not so much running for office  as she is auditioning to be a
regular voice for the Cons  A reaffirmation of sorts  She s been at this for a while  and they
have younger  more loopier and dim witted Con tarts traipsing about  Palin s taking time away
from them  but she has her own plans  which have yet to be revealed  though they may be all
too obvious  
Posted by  Lexaburn at October 20  2010 3 42 AM
Christine O Donnell is certainly ignorant in the sense that  while perfectly aware that
there are many things she doesn t know  she is clueless as to how that might be an
impediment  It s an odd combination   knowing you don t really have a solid grasp on a
subject  but still being convinced that one s core principals are enough to overcome any
obstacle 

O Donnell believes in the bible  She s a Jesus freak  And that s enough for her 

O Donnell is opposed to anything liberal  anything progressive  anything Obama  anything
Democrat  anything that can in any way be determined NOT to accord with the demands of her
savior and lord jesus christ  as SHE interprets his word  in any way  And that s enough
for her  The only reason she s a Republican   Tea Party gangster is because her brand of
theocracy and batshit stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else  In the stumped 
frustrated  hypocritcal idiocy of the extreme right   in that gang of redneck ignoramuses who
want simple answers to complex questions they do not understand   she finds the only market
for her brand of incompetent yammering 

Facts don t matter  Evidence doesn t matter  History doesn t matter  Just look at the clips
Bill Maher runs of her blithering  insistent certainty  She pisses off EVERYONE  all the time 
and never once   not a single time ever   stops long enough to even CONSIDER that maybe she s
the one who doesn t get it  It s THEY who don t get it  The constitutional lawyers don t
know fuck all about the constitution  She does because she took a week long course at Oxford
University! That she lies about her academic credentials  inflates beyond all reason and truth
the actual degree of study she has accomplished  does not in any way diminish her insistence
that she IS highly educated   really VERY knowledgeable about all of these things she doesn t
know about 

Richard Dawkins doesn t know anything about the  Theory  of evolution   he s just a cranky
atheist! She read a pamphlet from the Discovery Institute that totally explains the difference
between Creationism and Intelligent Design   which are not the same things  not at all  and
anyone who says they are is just wrong  Especially that court in Dover that found  as a matter
of FACT  that the ID crowd simply used  Find & Replace  to substitute  Intelligent Design 
for  Creation   resulting in numerous instances of  Intelligent Designism    But fuck it 
Everyone is wrong  Christine O Donnell is right  And if you disagree with her  then you are
properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things 

It may not be campaigning to WIN  She may well know that she s unelectable  But in her mind
that s because the voters have been brainwashed by the same evil  wrong headed liberal  
progressive indoctrination that has corrupted our schools  our leaders and our society 

Christine O Donnell doesn t have a hidden agenda  She sees herself as morally correct 
profoundly right  in both senses of the term   and struggling as only a jebus loving martyr
can against the tide of evil sweeping her nation  

As for why she consistently gets to appear on television  She s fuckable  in that weird
Sarah Palin way that makes me recoil in horror and wonder what the fuck is wrong with anyone
who would touch those women with their worst enemy s cock   She ll say apeshit nuts
things about masturbation  and flirting with witchcraft  and insist that these things that SHE
knows   things no one else knows  like the top secret information about China s plans to take
over the USA to which only SHE is privy!  places her in the unique position to lecture Obama
on Con Law  Henry Kissinger on foreign policy history  Richard Dawkins on evolution  Lawrence
Krause on cosmology and Murray Gell Mann on particle physics  She KNOWS things  see? Jebus
tells her things 

Frankly I think it s the result of the move in the 70 s and 80 s to tell students that they
were ALL special  that no one was any better or any smarter than anyone else  that everyone
has a RIGHT to their own opinion  to make sure that everyone who played the game got a
trophy  Now those self inflated  self important  self esteem fiddled crowd are running
for office  and they are fucking well convinced that they DO know as much as anyone else  and
their OPINIONS about things are just as valid as anyone else s   even moreso because  it s MY
opinion   and who are YOU to tell me that I don t know what I m talking about? YOU don t know
what you re talking about! 

Knowing she s going to lose is not the same thing as running TO lose    in the same way that
knowing she really doesn t know much about the constitution will never prevent her from
telling you what it must mean  She thinks she s right today  and she will think she s
right after being stomped to death at the polls  She will continue to blither her vacuous
bullshit on any platform she can find  spend campaign money on her rent  and go to bed every
night feeling as though she is fighting the good fight for jebus  truth and America

Lex   Thanks for the clarification  It looks like you might have an inside track into this
person s make up  But I m still going to think that her smile wasn t so much that she s in on
the joke as it was she really does think she knows what she s talking about  It is a
debate after all  a competition  To just shrug your shoulders and throw a hail mary pass with
a smile on your face would be suicidal  But really  who the hell knows?

Avi  I agree with you completely  except that I believe the  everyone is special  crowd
started in the 90 s  I grew up in the 70 s and there were no  gifted  programs for kids who
didn t happen to drool on themselves back then  The  entitlement because I deserve it 
generation is currently in their early to mid 20 s  My wife deals with them all the time at
her place of employment

United carbon offset disappointment
April 27  2009 9 08 AM


I m a big believer in carbon offsets  not so much the cap and trade game  but in
the simple internalize your externality sort   I talk about it in my Green
Culture talk  IMHO  we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon
footprint    now  My wife and I have been doing so for a couple years  We re a
couple months late buying credits for last year 

One reason we re late  other than the obvious  is the insane complexity in
calculating it well  I travel way too much  That s the biggest chunk to cover 
But to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights  I
could estimate  no doubt  But I want something more accurate 

So I was really happy to see on the United page an announcement of a  Carbon
Offset Program   What I expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what
the total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was  after all 
they have all the data   and ideally  a simple way to buy offsets 

No such luck  United has simple linked to one of the million places where you can
calculate a per flight carbon cost  It
allows you to input total miles flown  but its Mileage Plus page doesn t give you
total miles flown  it gives you the
total added to your account  included bonuses  etc  

Looking forward to version 2 0

Peter Collopy  Dopplr has a nice carbon calculator built in  You have to
enter all your trips  but I think it s generally an exciting system if you
don t mind the Little Brother surveillance 


April 27  2009 9 49 AM lessig  GREAT point  I do enter all mine in  Perfect
solution 


April 27  2009 9 53 AM
Padraic  Why aren t you a supporter of cap & trade? Isn t a mandatory
scheme going to moresuccesful than voluntary measures?


April 27  2009 10 20 AM lessig  I favor a mandatory scheme    internalize
your externality  I am suspicious of cap & trade  It seems like a
complicated partial version of that  created by the same genius quants who
gave us the mess on wall street  that is designed to generate large fees
finance types  My sense is for a simpler system 


April 27  2009 12 07 PM Padraic Ryan  Re  cap & trade   you shouldn t use
the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics  A cap &
trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the
US  finance types and all  You re right that a carbon tax is definitely
simpler  but there are upsides to cap & trade as well  such as the fact
that the market will drive the price up  whereas a tax won t increase unless
Congress wants it to  

Re  your green culture talk  I think you are misappropriating the Gore clip 
isn t he saying that your money would be better spent on political
candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of
externalities  changing the laws  instead of on carbon offsets  changing the
lightbulbs ? My problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is
that given the finite amount of money  energy and attention we have to push
for the environment  I feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is
too high compared to policy oriented actions  the citizen role that Gore
referred  For example  Earth Hour would be much more productive if it were a
global rally for carbon taxes  instead we de politicize it and entertain the
idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change 

I m a big fan of your work on IP and corruption  but I m skeptical of these
initial ventures into the environmental arena   


April 27  2009 12 17 PM mark   I am suspicious of cap & trade  It seems
like a complicated partial version of that  created by the same genius
quants who gave us the mess on wall street  that is designed to generate
large fees finance types  My sense is for a simpler system  

That just shows you do not fully understand the cap and trade model    or the
global financial crisis 


April 27  2009 2 51 PMCathy  When you book a route on United it tells you how
many miles it will accrue  pre bonus  for each leg   I use it to calculate
how many I ll get towards my premier status   It s a tiny link they move
around from time to time  but look for it near where the seat selection
option is  You should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket 
and possibly also after 


April 27  2009 4 45 PM Brad Templeton  When I got to United s site it has two
columns  one for true miles flown  sort of  and one for elite bonus  So cut
and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine  However  it does show
500 for the short haul flights  but I bet those are mostly L A  so you can
fill in the real mileage to L A  on those  it should not take long  April

offsets  particularly tree plantations  before spending money on them 
http   www newint org features 2006 07 01 keynote 


April 28  2009 9 03 AM Jardinero1  The only way to reduce your carbon
footprint  is to reduce your carbon footprint  period  Paying someone else
to do something they are doing  already  does not reduce your carbon
footprint one bit 

If you don t believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume
less  then please consider paying me  My wife and I telecommute  We rarely
travel  I ride my bike to the grocery store  We cook from whole ingredients
and never eat processed or prepared foods  Both of our cars are high mpg and
rarely used  They are both ten years old and we probably won t replace them
for another ten years  I just finished insulating my house and installed
high efficiency windows and HVAC  I keep the thermostat high in the summer
and low in the winter  All the light bulbs are fluorescent  except for the
dimmer above the dining room table  I removed all the turf from my property
and replaced it with vines and perennials  There are twenty three trees on
the property sequestering CO2 on a continuous basis  No motorized equipment
is required to maintain my garden which is now over ten thousand square feet
of CO2 consuming plants 

I would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from Prof Lessig or
anyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle  In return  I would submit
to an audit of my lifestyle and I would issue him a certificate stating the
amount of his carbon offset

Carbon offsets  harm environment 
http   news bbc co uk 1 hi uk_politics 6378471 stm Tuesday  20 February
2007  17 31 GMT


Jutta Kill  of the Forests and the European Union Resource Network  FERN  
was the most vehement opponent of the practice  arguing it probably did more
harm than good 

Carbon offsetting was  an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing
emissions   she argued  and its effects were impossible to verify 

In addition   More than half  of the money given to companies selling carbon
offsets went on research and administration costs   benefiting not the
climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry  

 We believe it is worse than nothing because it creates the illusion  or the
impression  in the public that action is being taken  while we are not
really addressing the task at hand  significantly reducing greenhouse gas
emissions   Ms Kill told MPs 


Illusions are powerful around here  it seems  Professor   stop listening to
your  intuitions  and do some basic research!



May 14  2009 2 45 PM Jason Sperling  It s nice to see feedback on the United
program  I ve posted your feedback on my carbon offsets news blog 

Currently many companies are reticent to putting something in their purchase
path as an upsell  just as they are reticent to putting anything in their
purchase path  The cost for large companies to make any updates to their
e commerce sites is significant  another factor in keeping the type of
program you d like from being available  Additionally  there is a reluctance
to share the data required for accurate emissions measurement due to
perceived potential risks  possibly related to future regulatory
concerns 

The technology is certainly available  When the type of program you imagine
IS put in place  the results have been very good  For example ShopGreen
Merchant Reports 90% of customers  go green

Tibetan Buddhist Retreat

         
Faded squares of fabric  strung together in repeating blue white red green yellow chains  crisscross the branches of
bare limbed trees  The gentle wind makes them flutter  Orange gold light filters into the grassy meadow  touching a row
of canvas tents and the temple house beyond  Tsechen Kunchab Ling   Temple of All Encompassing Great Compassion  This is the seat of His Holiness
the Sakya Trizin in the United States  a Tibetan Buddhist monastery established nine years ago 

I spent the past weekend there  The field work office at my college arranges this retreat every semester  Everyone
I ve talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it  this semester  one of my friends told me she
was going  I should join her! I like learning new things  so I signed up  A good decision  I didn t return all chill and
zen  as one friend told me his roommate had  but I certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over  and
dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world 

Medicine for one s mind

The first evening  the twenty something students  most from my college  four from another  gathered in the shrine
room  sitting cross legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy  He began
by telling us   Do not take any of what I say on faith  Take it through analysis  if there is some benefit in it for
you   Religion  he said  is like a drugstore full of medicine  You do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in
it  you just buy what would be beneficial to you now  You believe the other medicine may have just as much value  but in
other situations  not this one 

We discussed the foundations  the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma  the four noble truths  karma  defilements 
the six perfections  When we talked about the giving  and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient
beings  in the form of material items  kind words  protection  and so on   Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha 
and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat   So   a fellow student asked 
 Giving one s life for another being is the ultimate gift? 

Khenpo Kalsang  he smiled  and shook his head   Only if you feel no regret   he said   If you feel regret  it
destroys the merit   Until then  preserve your own life  and do not give away anything that would cause you regret  This
struck a chord  Self preservation above all else  unless the right situation arises 

Knowing and understanding

Later  I talked to the resident nun  Ani Kunga  about psychology and cognitive science  She had studied psychology
for a while in grad school  but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and
understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way   Psychologists   she said   study the brain and the self
externally  Ever since the 1920s  their science has been about observation of behavior  questionnaires  recordings of
electrical brain activity  But the mind can only be known by you  the person whose mind it is   She said
philosophy and epistemology were doing it right  looking at experiences from the inside 

A big overlap exists between Tibetan Buddhism  psychology and cognitive science  All three examine the distinction
between the self and others  between the observer and the observed  between knowing and the knower  I agree with Ani
Kunga to some extent  only so much can be known about the mind from external observation  But this doesn t mean that
there isn t merit to such studies  nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way 

Tibetan Buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside  During a second philsophy session 
Khenpo Kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the Buddha  This sutra delved into some
questions about the nature of the self  whether the self is a delusion  and how the clinging of self is a defilement  I
intend to discuss it in more depth later  so stay tuned 

Compassion training and prayer flags

In the afternoon  a group of us gathered outside for a meditation session with Ani Kunga  Sunshine melted lazily
through the tree branches above  a breeze animating the branches  shadows so they danced between our cushions 
Compassion and anger were the session s topics  The key message  

 If there s something you can do  why are you unhappy? Just do it  If there s nothing you can do  why are you
unhappy? 

Ani Kunga explained several off session and one on session technique for dealing with negative emotions  anger  hate 
irritation  stress  jealousy  and so on   All the methods built off the idea that you are in control  anger is an
emotion  and you can change your emotions  Stay tuned for a more in depth post on the topic 

Another of the day s activities was making prayer flags  As Ani Kunga explained   Prayers  wishes  hopes 
aspirations  someone  many people  may share those with you  Hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone
else in the world  This may do no good at all  but it may  if everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires  perhaps
it will do good  It may not  But if no one shares their prayers  it will certainly do no good 
So on the offchance that it will help  why not? 

Never done

This weekend reminded me that I m not done learning  If I stay still long enough  if I ve achieved a relatively
constant level of happiness and satisfaction  I forget that I can and should continue to seek out new ideas and
approaches  and incorporate beneficial ones into my life  A person is never  done   and so  I ll continue to observe and
discuss and study  trying to pick the directions in which I ll change  and trying to make tomorrow better than
today 

Ever onward and ever upward 
      
 
The Anti Terrorist   Undermining The Motivation For Terrorism

 By Rev  Bill McGinnis   Director   LoveAllPeople org

 This website and everything on it is in the Public Domain  so you may use it freely  even
without attribution  


BACKGROUND   September 11  2004
 Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001  and terrorism is a far
greater threat to us now than it was then  The number and severity of terrorist attacks
worldwide has increased dramatically  as has the number of active terrorists  Before 9 11 
terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals  loosely linked by radical
Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter  the USA  Now  many more moderate Muslims have
become radicalized  world wide  willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their
purposes  And the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in Russia  India  Maylasia 
the Philippines  Spain  and elsewhere  as well as Israel and its sole supporter  the United
States  True  the USA has not suffered a successful major attack since 9 11  but this does
not mean that we are safer  The terrorists could strike any time they choose  through any of
the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media  But they have chosen not to attack 
perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 9 11 attacks  so
they do not appear to be losing strength  What could be more spectacular than the 9 11 attacks?
Nuclear! Or massive bio chemical attack! And I think this is what they are waiting for  All of
our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small time casual attacks  but
they cannot stop a serious planned attack  any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious
robber who really wants to get into your house   So the Bush administration can keep
claiming that we are safer now  under their policies  But this claim is merely feel good
propaganda  intended to keep the neo cons in power  It cannot withstand clear headed scrutiny 
The fact is  Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism  much less defeat
it  By trying to  stamp out  terrorism by killing terrorists  Bush and Israel have made things
infinitely worse for us  more dangerous  not safer  And proof that Bush has failed may come at
any moment  explosively  with one big successful attack here in the USA   May God help
us all  
WHAT IS TERRORISM?
 TERRORISM is  the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a
population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective   Source  Britannica com
http   www britannica com search?query terrorism&ct   We believe that any terrorist act
is a crime against humanity and against the will of God  because it deliberately intends to
injure and kill innocent people  

NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM
 Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it  Without
motivation  terrorism will quickly die down  like a plant without water  
 We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force  because brute
force radicalizes the moderates  and they then join the terrorists  So you end up fighting the
entire population  Brute force has failed in Palestine  and it is failing in Iraq  
 We try to be even handed in opposing all terrorism  although we recognize that the greatest
terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah
approves of their criminal behavior against Israel  The United States  Russia  India  the
Philippines  Australia  and others whom they falsely believe to be  waging war against Allah  
And the second greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries  mainly Israel  who
sometimes resort to terrorism themselves  claiming  self defense   as they desperately try to
prevent further attacks by radical Muslims  In all of these cases above  if the radical Muslims
would cease their attacks  all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end  
 Beyond these two sources  there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world  with the
possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic
episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups  

The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and
erroneous  They need to be identified and attacked  If the terrorist loses faith in the
righteousness of his acts  he is less likely to perform them  


EXAMPLE 1   Terrorists
Offend Allah  


EXAMPLE 2   Terrorist
Murderers Insult Allah  Bring Shame To Islam 


EXAMPLE 3  LATEST AND BEST!
  Framed Below    Qur an Forbids Terrorism 


In every case of terrorism  we will find some kind of legitimate underlying
grievance  If we eliminate the legitimate grievances  we have eliminated much of the
motivation  
 Is this  negotiating with terrorists  or  trying to appease the terrorists   as some
Israeli NeoCons would try to say? No  It is simply recognizing the realities of human
motivation  right or wrong  To deny reality  as the Israeli NeoCons do  is to invite disaster 
as they have done

I can t believe I wrote all that last year 
Acephalous

Friday  07 May 2010



Because I ve been grading all damn day and am as tired as a Swearengen of hearing
other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger 
I thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a
 Best of Acephalous 2009  post  However  when I started
looking through my archives  it occurred to me that my output this year defines
me much more sharply than in years past  What do I mean? 
The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to
have been composed in 2009  Granted  the likelihood that I m suffering from the
identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high  but I honestly thought
I d written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so   It may also be
that I remember the scene of their writing  which would have been in the old
apartment  i e  the place I barely remember ever having
lived in anymore   If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday
night  feel free to scan through my 2009
archives and tell me what you think should be included in the  Best of 
post  
If you do have something better to do  though  by all means do
it

Why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a Friday night 
Granted grading papers is important  but no fun makes for a boring life  I
should know   since  when I was your age I had fun playing with my adorable

computer  Just saying    it seems I have more life now then you have and we
know how little I get out!

 The one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of Watchmen   I d
read Watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity 
but not being used to reading comics  hadn t registered all the technical
tricks that the artist was using to achieve this  The post not only taught
me something about the grammar of such images  but more importantly led to
me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place  So
thanks a lot for that one

SEK  I started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my

html  to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics
posts  like the one Magistra mentioned and many others after that  Plus
Justifying Comics as a Legitimate Object of Study Parts I & II  I also
liked  Teaching the Overdetermined Image   Your takedown of Cashill and the
whole Ayers wrote Dreams was excellent  and the Cruel_cruel_death post  you
know what I m talking about  right?  

Also  The Day in Actual Communist and Real Nazi History seems as relevant
today as ever

The effect of not being on vacation in Italy on a man with a tall stack of
papers to grade 

As you probably noticed  my wife is currently on vacation without me  — which is different
than a vacation from me  although given how frequently insufferable I am 
I could understand the appeal of such—in the le Marche region of Italy  which is immediately
south of Tuscany and full of communists  As evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is  I
present a picture  courtesy of her  of the cabin she ll be staying in free of
charge until July 
 That s the view she ll be writing her dissertation to the next two months  The region is poor
 though not so much as I thought  and
poorly serviced by internet and wifi  there s a router up the hill from her which sometimes
provides wifi  but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day  So the
only opportunity I have to talk to her  via Skype  is that last hour in the late evening when
the loft cools enough to be habitable—provided  of course  that the wifi strength that evening
is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection  Which it frequently isn t  But this
post isn t about how melancholy I become when I haven t heard from her by 3 p m   which would be
midnight over there   because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino  not my daily descent into emo  
I ve written about Urbino before   but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs
of the city  I feel compelled to do so again  As I noted in that post  Urbino is not a
 built  city so much as an  evolved  one   The De Landa seems to
have become an unwitting
theme of late   Of course it was built   but it was built vertically
within the city walls  meaning that new buildings were constructed atop
existing ones like so 
 The effect is the sort of architecture one only finds in dreams or representations of them 
like the one in the finale of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire
Slayer   wherein Joss Whedon took advantage of contiguous three walled film sets to depict
Xander Harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at Buffy s house 

Into the Initiative s underground bunker  
Then  from the bathroom Initiative across the hall 
Into his parent s basement 
And into an ice cream truck 
Past the the come hither lesbians 
Through the back of the ice cream truck 
By means of a passage  
That returns him to you guessed it his parents  basement 
In which he exits the same door he originally entered it from Buffy s house only to end up in
the halls of Sunnydale High and  shortly  an Apocalypse Now parody 
 The only difference between what Whedon did and Urbino is that you could travel through the
side streets of Urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats  minus the Coppola  without needing to cut once   Because without leaving officially sanctioned
lanes of transportation  pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens  university
departments  the central hallway of apartment buildings  and so on  This photograph of the
dueling signs for the Hotel Raffaello the wife snapped the other day typifies the way the city
feels 
 You can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story
window of an adjacent building   This isn t technically true  but it accurately describes how it
feels to those unaccustomed to the city s geography   The city is even
more disturbing  though  because of the tendency of its sidewalks to transform into recessed
brick ladders when the street becomes too steep for bipeds
  That picture is not from the current set  as the relative quality attests  and if I remember
correctly—by which I mean   recognize the fingerprints of amateur photographers the world
over who think a  good  photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way
possible —snapped by me   I only mention that because in 2002 I visited the city with the
wife and  as you probably guessed  the real point of this post was to indulge in a bit of
vicarious vacationing before returning to a stack of ungraded papers that no amount of actual
grading seems to have the power to reduce  
 If it wasn t  even Homer nods? No  but seriously  if that s not a picture I actually took 
it s exactly the sort I relentlessly take  whereas check out the wife s chops above  the woman has
an eye  



If she is working  she is not on vacation  AND this time apart will make you stronger and
make you realize marriage is work and you need to put some in or the marriage dies and you are
left with an empty hole in your heart  I know this is over kill  but you need to get out of
the funk you are in and grade the papers and finish the course so you can get some down time
and catch up on your sleep

         Self control  Self efficacy  and New Year s Resolutions
         Unresolved
         
I m not one to make New Year s resolutions 

I mean  sure  I could take my pick of popular New Year s resolutions   I could decide  on the
first day of the new year  that this year  I ll start exercising more and eating better  or that I ll spend more time
with my family and friends  or that I ll learn a new skill  And if I chose to make resolutions  I d be far from alone  a
2008 survey on Dorthy com found that 66% of the 2000  adults polled
had made resolutions at some point  though only 17% managed to keep them  

Making resolutions  It s about self control

The question Anirban Mukhopadhyay of the Hong Kong University and Gita Venkatarmani Johar of the Graduate School of
Business at Columbia University asked is this  What determines how many goals a person will set  and
how successful a person will be at achieving those goals? They performed a few studies in 2005 to look at the
relationship between self control  goal setting  and goal achievement  They suggested that what you believe about self control affects the
goals you set and achieve  PDF  

In the paper   self control  is used to mean a sense of willpower  Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various
lay theories of self control  noting that the amount of self control a person has can be seen as either an inherently
limited or unlimited resource  and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed  the amount of
self control a person has can change over time  or not   An important premise to note here is the idea that the
probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained  So if you
think you ll be able to achieve a goal  you re more likely to set it  Combine this with theories of self control  and in
general  if you believe you have unlimited stores of self control  you ll set a larger number of goals  If you believe
self control is malleable but limited  you ll set fewer goals 

Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self efficacy  belief in one s capabilities  the perceived ability to
carry out a desired action  They propose that people with high self efficacy  people who believe that failure is the
result of insufficient effort  and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence  will achieve more of their goals
than people with low self efficacy  who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability  and thus may simply
give up 

The studies

In the first study  85 participants  all college students  each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of
self control  Each passage contained two paragraphs  the first discussed self control either as limited or as unlimited 
and the second discussed self control as either malleable or fixed  The participants then answered questions about their
belief in each of two theories presented  followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation  in which they listed
all their current goals 

The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited  malleable self control would result in most resolutions  and
indeed  this is what was found  The experimenters had some concerns about participants  natural beliefs in relation to
the passages they read  however  so in study two  the order of the two measures  lay theories and motivation goal
listing  was varied  Data from 130 new participants revealed that  as hypothesized  if the motivation & goals
questionnaire were assessed first  then among the people who believed self control is malleable  those who also believed
self control to be unlimited  vs  limited  set more goals  When lay theories were assessed first  this result reversed 
The people who believed that self control is fixed were unaffected by order 

The third study moved on to examine goal achievement  adding a measure to look at self efficacy  The study had two
sessions  in November then February  In the first session   the 159 participants read passages about lay theories  much
like in study one  but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation   listed the resolutions they were planning
on making at New Years  rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions  and filled out
individual difference measures  which included a self efficacy scale   Only 86 participants successfully returned for
the second session  during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions 

What does this mean for your resolutions?

The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar  take a look at any list of
popular New Year s resolutions  and you ll see the majority of the goals   As shown in the first two studies  more goals
were set by people who believe self control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people  that is  if you expect
more success  you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself  Self efficacy did not have
a significant effect on goal setting 

As far as success goes  only the interaction between lay theory and self efficacy was significant  If participants
believed in limited self control and were low in self efficacy  they tended to give up more often  failing to achieve
their goals  But if participants believed in unlimited self control  self efficacy had no effect  participants achieved
just as many goals regardless  and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed 

Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay
theories of self control and beliefs about one s own amount of self control and self efficacy  and propose this as an
area for future study  But in general  lay theories about self control can determine how much success you ll expect  and
thus  how many goals you ll set   and self efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you ll actually have

The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long lasting and controversial
   ones ever  What  exactly  causes homosexuality? Some would say it is a gene  passed
   on from parents to child  Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s
upbringing  Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be
cured  Perhaps then  it is a combination of some of these? No one knows for sure  and
it is possible no one ever will  but that surely does not stop everyone from coming
up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter 
Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of
the time  where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence  Emond  
In his book The Symposium  Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue
males  and being slices  so to speak  of the male  love men throughout their boyhood 
and take pleasure in physical contact with men”  qtd  in Isay 11   This shows that
not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male  he
also believed that it began at a very young age  as the word “boyhood” signifies  In
fact  Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only
“real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy  Furthermore  there were many
occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology  Hercules is rumored to have
had 14 male lovers  and Zeus himself partook in such behavior  Even Homer wrote about
Achilles and Patroclus  who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love
Emond  
But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used  to describe “a
man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex”
Marcus 1    However  for the purposes of this paper  homosexuality will be looked at
solely in terms of men   At this point in time  Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in
a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia 
Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for
“sex ” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are
for the opposite sex”  Marcus 1  
It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was
started by Magnus Hirschfeld  a physician  sex researcher  leading sexologist 
homosexual  and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany  who believed
that homosexuality was biological in nature  Marcus 10   Hirschfeld also founded the
Scientific Humanitarian committee  which was mostly homosexual  in 1897  The
committee published many books and other forms of literature  which gave Hirschfeld a
great amount of prestige in his field  He became known as one of the founding fathers
of sexology  and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological
institute  the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin  in 1919  which was destroyed
by the Nazis 15 years later  Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl
Ulrichs  with minor additions  he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of
homosexuality  but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with
the use of hormone injections  This theory  which defined Urnings as males who turned
to other males as sexual partners  was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs 
starting in1864  The first  Vindex  defended Urnings  while the second  Inclusa 
which followed shortly after  described the first scientific theory of homoerotic
desire  Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were
“hermaphrodites of the mind ” meaning while they may have been male in body  they
were female in soul and mind  leading them to be naturally attracted to males in
terms of sexual partners  This  he claimed  made laws such as paragraph 175  a law
adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their
unification which forbade sex between males  and forced criminal penalties upon
individuals partaking in such behavior  unfair and unreasonable   Ulrichs claimed
that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn  Wikholm  
A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer  Sigmund Freud still believed
homosexuality to be a natural behavior  In an interview in 1903  he professed his
beliefs  “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick
people… Homosexual persons are not sick  They also do not belong in a court of law!”
qtd  in Isay 3   In 1935  he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter
to an American Mother” of a homosexual  which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly
no advantage  but is nothing to be ashamed of  no vice  no degradation  it cannot be
classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern
times have been homosexuals”  qtd  in Isay 3  
However  the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s  including the medical
professionals  regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness  Treatments such as
castration  hysterectomy  lobotomy  and electroshock therapy were used as attempted
cures  By the mid 1900s  psychotherapy became the most common “cure ” and many
homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual
preference  Dudley 125  
Dr  Evelyn Hooker  a heterosexual psychologist  conducted a ground breaking study in
the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud  In this courageous
experiment  Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men  half homosexual
and half heterosexual  She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that
homosexuality was a mental illness  and concluded that there was no significant
psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men  “gay” men were no
more insane than their “straight” counterparts  Marcus 183  
Fortunately  many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an
illness  and their lobbying  along with the innovative study performed by Hooker  who
has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American
Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973  Just over
a year later  the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from
their list of mental illnesses  Marcus 11   The American Psychological Association
further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of
Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual
Orientation in 1997  which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure”
homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment  It stated  rather that
homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person 
but must still be respected as an individual orientation  and thus treated as one
Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation  
Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael
Bailey  an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University  and Richard
Pillard  an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of
Medicine  and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics  For
two years  these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both
monozygotic  or identical twins  a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg
and thus having identical DNA   and dizygotic  or fraternal twins  a set of twins
from too separate zygotes  causing them to have similar DNA  but not any more so than
that of two ordinary siblings   in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males
meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment   In
total  110 pairs of twins  identical and fraternal  and 142 sets of male and their
adopted brothers were studied  where at least one of the two had been classified as
homosexual  either by self identification or other means  Out of the 56 homosexual
males who had identical twins  29  or approximately 52 % of their identical twin
brothers were also found to be homosexual  as compared to only 12  or approximately
22 % of the 54 non identical twins of homosexual males  and 6  or approximately 11 %
of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of
genetics  Strangely enough  the study also included pairs of biological brothers that
were not twins  and out of the 142 homosexual males studied  only 14  or about 9 % 
had homosexual brothers  which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of
homosexuality in the general population  Bailey & Pillard  
More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice ”
but rather a feeling that one is born with  As one grows older  they become aware of
sexual feelings towards other persons  The only difference between homosexuals and
heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite
sex  homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex  Therefore  neither
homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter  and asking a
homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking
a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?” After all  why
would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle? As a homosexual  one risks horrifying
their parents  other family members  and friends to the point of losing all contact
with them  ruining their career  being condemned by their religion  being beat up for
publicly displaying their sexuality  and much much more  Rather  the only actual
choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference 
whether to act on one’s sexual desires  whether to tell others about such feelings 
or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions  Marcus

To supplement my findings from research  I have conducted personal interviews with
two adolescent homosexual males  James Dobbens and Daniel Woods  Both were asked how
what they thought determined homosexuality  nature vs  nurture  and why  when they
realized they were homosexual and how they knew  and similar questions  Both believed
that homosexual was a result of nature  rather than nurture  Dobbens & Woods  
Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual 
“They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’  Dobbens   Dobbens believes that he
was born homosexual  When why he was a homosexual  he explained “It’s just the way
you are  you can’t explain it  I was just born that way  it’s like asking how the
world was made – no one really knows”  Dobbens   He went on to explain that while his
nurture did not impact his sexual orientation  it did affect his view of it  When
discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality  he commented
“They can bring you up  to be  open minded to  homosexuality   but they don’t bring
you up  to be a homosexual … I grew up in a place where  homosexuality is accepted  
so that’s why I’m so open about being gay  I accept myself…  Whether or not you
accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual  depends
on how you’re brought up”  Dobbens   Woods generally agreed with Dobbens  and
justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature  rather than
nurture  when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to
anything like  homosexuality ”  Woods   When asked why he was gay  he explained that
it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head  nothing made me do
it”  Woods   He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction
between males and females  only it was between males and other males  He added that
“nothing happened  to make me homosexual   it’s always been there  I’ve always been
attracted to guys”  Woods   What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that
he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys  he is
romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend
and to be close with other females  etc… but never in a sexual sense  Though he has
“always kind of fantasized about getting married  to a female  ” these feelings come
from his “romantic side  which is different from the sexual side”  Woods   He says
that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust  maybe he could work
it out  He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic 
“It’s like race  It’s all something you can’t help  it all comes to you… It’s
internal  you can’t help it”  Woods   When asked if he thought homosexuality was
caused by a gene  he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct  He
gave the example of birds  which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build
a next  or catch their prey  Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something
in the development of the embryo  All in all  Woods views homosexuality as
“fascinating ” His final thought  “I also believe everyone has at least one
homosexual attraction  It’s not black and white  homosexual vs  heterosexual   it’s a
spectrum”  Woods  
Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics  According to
Darwin’s theory of natural selection  the advantageous traits are passed on  while
the disadvantageous ones eventually die out  For instance  heterosexual males have an
average of five times as many children as homosexual ones  as a female is required to
reproduce children  yet homosexuals are  by definition  not sexually attracted to
females  Therefore  from the evolutionary standpoint  homosexuality becomes one of
the disadvantageous traits  Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five
times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool  if homosexuality was
indeed caused by a gene  it would have died out entirely by now  or at least been
reduced immensely in the number of occurrences  Since neither of these events have
yet taken place  it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene
Fulkerson  
My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no
definitive answer on what causes homosexuality  No one knows for sure now  although
many think they do   and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth  Nonetheless 
I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of
genetic and environmental causes  Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition
towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations  However this
does not necessarily determine a homosexual  rather this predisposition must be
triggered by environmental factors  This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their
study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same
genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality  this was not the case 100 % of
the time  This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now  but even as I write
this  new studies are being done  Perhaps the truth is right around the corner

            Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years  Unfortunately  as of yet  no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds  and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society  Infiltrating insect societies  however  is much simpler  Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees  ants and cockroaches  and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already  Halloy et al  2007   No robot has yet been constructed  however  that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus  nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them  Such a robot would allow for both long term studies of ant robot interactions and studies of task switching in the robots  I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot  hereafter referred to as Antie  that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest  switching between the foraging  patrolling and midden work behaviors 
            
            Environment
            The red harvester ant lives in hot  dry deserts  building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain  The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds  many of which do not grow in the desert  Gordon  54   where only a few varieties of small shrubs  small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow  Gordon  51   Other insects and creatures  including other species of ants  are present in the desert  but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals  Gordon  7 11   Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests  intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive  Gordon  11   Because of this  I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie  and will not create a fighting behavior  Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil 
            
            The Ant & the Robot
            Ants of this species are of two types  breeding ants  queens and drones  and sterile female workers  Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal  as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season  which occurs but once per year  The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories  brood care  nest maintenance  patrolling and foraging  Little is known about brood care  as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest  Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest  but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest  midden work  occurs close enough to the surface to be observable  Patrolling and foraging  too  occur for the most part outside of the nest  and have therefore been studied extensively  ex   Schafer  et al  2006  Gordon  et al  2002  Gordon  2002  Gordon  1987   It is therefore these three behaviors that I would like to focus on in this proposal  the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model  and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe 
            These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler  though there is some overlap  particularly with navigational problems  In the case of midden work  Antie must be able to identify garbage  grasp it  carry it out of the nest  and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum  or until stimulated to switch behaviors   Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub behaviors  nest patrolling and trail patrolling  An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound  presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit  Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers  who may then  upon smelling the returning patroller  be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest  An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest  wander around searching for food sources  identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is  This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow  Gordon  33 34  Holldobler et al  1990  as cited in Webb  1998   In addition to following these trails to the food  foragers must also be able to identify food  grasp it and carry it back to the nest  Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks  as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task   walk  navigate both within and outside of the nest  and of course switch tasks at appropriate times 
            
            The Agent 
            
            Chassis
            Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system  Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C  for which some pseudocode is included  Sensors will include a thermometer  photoreceptors  bump sensors  a polarization compass  and a series of chemical receptors  Antie be a circular robot  no more than 1cm in diameter  the length of a red harvester ant   with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization  A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs  Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors  sonar detectors and chemical emitters  including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging  These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted  Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance  For the purposes of this proposal  I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day  A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached   Fig 1 
            
            Sensors
            In order to inform itself about its environment  Antie will need a number of sensors  In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible  these sensors include a thermometer  photoreceptors  bump sensors and sonar  a polarization compass  and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae  On its front grippers  Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure  The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function 
            The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way  and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius  Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius  Gordon  9   and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in nest navigation 
            Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes  These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night  the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night  Gordon  5  
            The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects  The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation  and the bump sensors will  when depressed  also initiate the escape function  The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability  and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions 
            The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and  45 degrees from the center front of Antie  respectively  that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern  These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light  and research has shown that many insects  including ants  do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer  Labhart  et al  2002   Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos  Moller  Labhart  Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000  consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers   Fig 2  The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie  who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest  Upon each exit from the nest  Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky  and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later  This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest  given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos  et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning 
            
            
               
            
            Fig  2  Diagram of the polarization opponent unit described by Lambrinos  et al  2000   The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier  which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes  The e vector  heading  returned from the two polarization sensitive photodiodes  1  2  follows a cos2 function 
            
            Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae  and to mimic this  Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants  who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae  and take in chemical information  These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons  which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task  perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun  causing a different ratio of n alkanes to n alkenes and the presence of branched n alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile  Wagner  et al  2001  as cited in Gordon & Greene  2003   Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves  which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate  Arnold  et al  1996  as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi  1999   receptors to detect food  and receptors for three types of pheromones  those released by successful foragers returning with food  those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest  and those marking piles of trash as midden  Research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning  Schafer  et al  2006   Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity  foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns  Gordon  2002   and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest  Gordon & Greene  2003  Greene & Gordon  2007   Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way  since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species  Gordon  35   For the purposes of this proposal  I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone  All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks  with four of each type of receptor per stalk  This technique  described by Ishida  et al  2001   has been shown to improve the chemical plume tracking abilities of robots  The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on board PC 
            Finally  Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object  These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson  et al  Patent  4 492 949   and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage  These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles  which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects  A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below 
            
            Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants  There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs  Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers  emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles  A third motor will lift and lower the grippers  allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head  Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs  These will be located in different places  the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie  corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths  while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt  Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task  on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants  Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section 
            
            The Behavior
            
            Antie will have a hybrid software architecture  a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors  but many sub behaviors will operate on a schema basis  Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible  and where appropriate  different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked 
            
            Common Behaviors
            A few sub behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior  To ease Antie’s on board memory requirements and processing capabilities  and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand   I propose a few global variables and subroutines 
            The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode  and are compiled here for ease of reference 
            
               number representing calibration for speed

            Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism  procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside  in nest navigation  an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into  object identification and gripping  a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following  and the identification of other ants 
            For a simple start  the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed 
            
               Forward cruise
               Takes in a number representing the desired speed 
               Causes robot to cruise forward at said speed 
               Speeds assumed to be on a 1 10 scale  10 being fastest  
            
            void forCruz double speed   
               Each wheel input  gets  the appropriate speed
               Calibrate is a double representing a calibration
               initialized to zero and altered as necessary 
            
               The robot will receive the “GO” command as long as
               this function is running 
            
            left_motor_OP   speed   calibrate 
            right_motor_OP   speed 
                 end forCruz
            
            A similar rotate function will be used to orient Antie towards a particular heading 
            
               Rotate
               Takes in a desired angle to rotate the robot and 
               rotates accordingly
               Assume that 10s is sufficient to rotate the robot 
               completely around one wheel  this may be changed 
               in implementation 
            
            void rotate int angle   
               If angle to turn is to the right  rotate left wheel 
               for a portion of 10s in accordance with desired 
               angle s proportion of a circle
            if angle>0   
            while   timer  < 10   angle   360   
            left_motor_OP   5 
            right_motor_OP   0 
             
               else rotate right wheel for appropriate portion of 10s
            else  
            while   timer  < 10   angle   360   
            left_motor_OP   0 
            right_motor_OP   5 
                 end while
                 end else
                 end rotate
            
            These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis  and when combined with the forward cruise function  should cause the robot to move at an angle 
            In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside  Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading  and also how far from the nest it is at its current location  The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos  et al  Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest  and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance  We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees  positive or negative  and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters  The first function might look something like this 
            
               Nest Orient
               Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs
               and returns the location of the nest in degrees 
            int nestOrient double left_POL_IP  double right_POL_IP   
            int degrees   0 
               Calculates direction of nest  and returns as degrees 
            return degrees 
                 end nestOrient
            
            The second function  which would return the distance in centimeters  might look something like this 
            
               Nest Distance
               Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs
               and returns the current distance to the nest 
            int nestDist double left_POL_IP  double right_POL_IP   
            int dist   0 
               Calculates distance from nest  returning distance in cm 
            return dist 
                 end nestDist
            
            In nest navigation will be a function of the temperature  read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source  To exit  Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight  and to get deeper  Antie will seek a lower temperature  The code may look something like this 
            
               Exit Nest
               Uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest
               entrance from inside
            
            void nestExit    
               Reads temperature  scoots forward 1s  reads temperature
               again  takes the difference  and determines whether current 
               heading is increasing temperature reading  If not  rotates    45 degrees and tries again 
            while photo_IP < sunrise   
            double temp   temp_IP 
            while  timer  < 1  
            forCruz 5  
             
            temp    temp_IP 
            if temp>0  rotate 45  
                 end nestExit
            
            To enter the nest  such as at the end of a task  Antie will perform the same function  except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature  it will avoid light  and it will only activate while Antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance  This void function will be called nestEnter    and will take in no inputs  
            To avoid bumping into things  including other ants   Antie be provided with an escape function  Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount  and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction  Regardless  this will be a very simple function  I will include one example 
            
               Escape
               Escapes from danger when bump sensors or sonar are 
               activated 
            
            void escape    
               Declare and initialize left bump sensors in 
               order from front to back 
            bump_left1 
            bump_left2 
            bump_left3 
            bump_left4 
               Declare and initialize right bump sensors in 
               order from front to back 
               Sonar sensors are globally declared 
            
            if bump_left1   
               reverse …  at reduced speed 
            forCruz  3  
               … and rotate!
            rotate 45  
             
                 end escape
            
            Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it  this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds 
            Before picking objects up  however  Antie will need to identify them  This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated  Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell  Objects will include midden and food  The code may look something like this 
            
               Object Identification
               Identifies an object that has snuck up on the 
               unsuspecting robot 
            
            void objID    
               Declare and initialize front bump sensor 
               Sonar sensors are globally declared 
            
               Check inputs to determine which smell is strongest
               if food smell is detected at higher rate and 
               above the food threshold for detection  Antie 
               assumes object is food
            while  bump_front ||  sonar_left_IP && sonar_right_IP    
            if   left_midden_IP   right_midden_IP  
            <   left_food_IP   right_food_IP  
            &&   left_food_IP   right_food_IP  
            > food_threshold   
            food_detect   true 
             
               if midden smell is detected at higher rate 
               and above threshold for midden detection  
               Antie assumes object is midden
            else if   left_midden_IP   right_midden_IP  
            >   left_food_IP   right_food_IP  
            &&   left_midden_IP   right_midden_IP  
            > midden_threshold   
            midden_detect   true 
             
                 end objID
            
            Once the object has been identified  Antie may grip it and lift it  A simple void function grip   taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached  at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying  A void function release   will perform this same action in reverse 
            Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails  it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers  and localize the source of food odors and midden odors  Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past  Webb  1998   regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones  As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing  a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk  The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP ” Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles  Experiments in Synthetic Psychology ” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell  et al  2003  to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models  Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces  I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine  Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis 
            
               Follow Gradient
               Follows a generic chemical gradient  seeking a higher
               concentration 
            
            void gradientFollow    
               Compares left and right inputs and activates opposite
               motor to a greater degree  
            if  left_IP > right_IP   
             schema   
            rotate  90  
            forCruz 5  
                 end schema
                 end if
            if  right_IP > left_IP   
             schema   
            rotate 90  
            forCruz 5  
                 end schema
                 end if
            else forCruz 5  
                 end gradientFollow
            
            For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode  I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow    findFood    and findMidden    All three are void and take no inputs 
            The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants  When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously  Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate  As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non nestmates  Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest  Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n alkenes to n alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n alkanes  The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun  which depletes their n alkene levels  Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n alkene levels  The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this 
            
               Ant Identification
               Identifies an ant that has snuck up on the 
               unsuspecting robot 
            
            void antID    
            while  left_sonar_IP && right_sonar_IP   
               Are hydrocarbons present?  Is this a nestmate? 
            if  left_hydrocarb_IP   right_hydrocarb_IP 
            > hydrocarb_threshold   
            nestmate_detect   true 
               In what task is the nestmate engaged?

            Using these basic common behaviors  more complex behaviors may be coded 
            Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan  but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony  Gordon  1996   Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age  ex   Ingram  et al  2005  and partially as a function of interactions with other workers  ex   Schafer et al  2006  Gordon  2002  Greene & Gordon  2007   Younger ants work more inside the nest  and older ants work more outside the nest  As a result  I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in  Midden work  which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside  will occur first  patrolling  which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside  will occur second  and foraging will be the final behavior  Finally  I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors 
            The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior  It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise  and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC  at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest  As previously stated  a midden worker must identify midden  grasp it  and carry it to the surface  depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden  A program encoding this behavior might look like this 
            
                                                                      
               MIDDEN WORK
                                                                      
               Antie will leave nest in the morning after sunrise 
               carrying bits of midden halfway down the nest mound
               and depositing them  Antie will return to the nest and
               repeat this task until the temperature reaches above
               52 degrees Celsius 
            
            void midden

            while  photo_IP > sunrise && temp_IP < 52   
               Find midden and identify any found objects  If
               they are midden  grip and carry outside nest

            objID   
            if midden_detect   
            grip

               cruise to halfway down the nest mound
            while nestDistance   < 25   
            forCruz   
             
            release

            midden_detect   0 
            nestEnter   
                 end if
                 end while
                 end midden
            
            The second behavior  patrolling  involves two sub behaviors  nest patrolling and trail patrolling  Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest  roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes  and reentering the nest  This behavior will be implemented in two parts  with a task switching algorithm based on age  Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy  Moron  et al  2007   and that task switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages  Ingram  et al  2005   It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling  In order to perform both of these functions  Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig zag fashion  as harvester ants do  Gordon  34   Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory  though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories  Gordon  57 60   To control for this behavior  Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones  This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day  even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths  Gordon  45   The code may look something like this

            Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again  Trail patrollers will go much further  until food sources are found  and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow  A general site of food is all that the patroller need find  the foragers will dig through the sand for the food  Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this  note that part is on a schema basis

            For the task switching in the patrolling behavior  assume some variable “age” that Antie has been keeping track of using the CPU’s clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup  The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks

            The final behavior  foraging  will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R  Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume  This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds  and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest  This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them  It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter clockwise  The code for this  adapted from Russell’s paper  might look like this 
            
               Hex path search
               Localizes an object through sand using chemical detection

            Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest  even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path  Gordon  47   To address this  a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon  The code might look like this

               Main foraging behavior function 
               Foragers will exit the nest upon activation and follow
               a trail laid by the patrollers  Upon completion of the
               trail following  will locate and grip food  returning
               to the nest  Boolean forage_today represents Antie’s
               activation status for each day once it has switched to 
               the foraging behavior 
            
            void forage    
               Wait for a successful patroller to return

               Note that this is NOT a schema basis  which would 
               cause Antie to stop and retrieve food encountered en 
               route 
               When end of plume is reached  retrieve food 
            while  !food_detect   
               while food has not yet been found  continue searching 
               and identifying found objects

               Once that loop has been broken  return to nest

               grip food and return to nest

            nestEnter   
             
               release food just inside nest entrance
            release   
                 end while
                 end forage
            
            Of course  what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task switching between these larger behaviors  Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior  I will not address task switching to midden work  Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants  and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot  To remind the reader  this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling  The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer  et al  2006   and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers  Gordon  2002   Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate  According to Schafer’s  et al  model of forager activation  every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit  a fraction  modeled at 0 0035  of inactive foragers joins the queue  For the purposes of modeling Antie  I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent  irreversible and partly a function of age  with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers  The code to model this task switching might look something like this

               of an ant being simulated  Int nestpatrol_age refers to the 
               starting age at which Antie will begin to nest patrol  
               forage_age refers to the starting age at which Antie may be 
               activated to forage  This would correspond to the change in 
               gene expression described by Gordon  2002

            Antie will be a fully autonomous  situated and embodied agent  infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task switching thresholds  but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary  Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers  and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms  such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance

            Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America  
            The Rediscovery of Language and Identity
            Humans  in the process of defining themselves  look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others  This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture  a group of people joined by characteristics  traits  and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity  discernible from that of those “outside” them  those who do not belong  Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things   clothing  food  lifestyle choices  One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language  The command of a language  while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it  is often the key to gaining entry  In turn communal identity can be formed around a language  it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers  Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America  the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key  Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity  particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has  In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases  that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia  Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”  and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages 
            The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far reaching and deeply embedded in both countries  One of the most prominent  lasting influences is that of the land grant system  Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system  in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land  This was in turn replaced by the repartimento  the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish  providing labor and taxes as demanded  In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish  resulting in modern day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists  Warren 1978  7 8   Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers  The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century  Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations  previously  both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture  The Marxists  on the contrary  argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity  However  they also claimed that they were part of a larger group  the working class  whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism  therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker friendly one  Jackson 1995  6 7   
            In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party  A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists  who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response  Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life  multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence  often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples  This is similar to the situation of Guatemala  the government felt it needed to battle communism  an “armed and dangerous menace within”  plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s  Warren 1993  25   This resulted in persecution against the Mayans  who make up about 60% of the overall population  In both counties  guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples  in many cases there were coalitions  but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote  inaccessible villages as hideouts  In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed  200 000 Mayans were killed  and over 1 million more were displaced  The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord  Warren 2002  157 158  
            The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements  By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen  and indigenous rights movements formed  Warren 2003  174  Jackson 2002  82   Central to these was the question of indigenous identity  largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence  local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture  Pan Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language  despite local dialectical differences  it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people  Most still speak it in various forms  and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent  modern version of Maya  England 2003  733  739   Pan Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity  it largely avoids specifically political overtones  instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture  England 2003  734   The popular left  however  continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool  It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse   The Pan Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the  often negative  attention of the government  England 2003  735  Warren 2003  181   A main concern among pan Mayanists is the reversal of the long seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people  despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population  they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society  This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism  Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility  whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior  Pan Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance  a language of power and prestige  England 2003  736   By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority 
            Colombia  in contrast  has no unified  pan Indian  sentiments  the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population  a fractured entity divided by region and language  Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed  the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan Indian group  yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples  Jackson 2002  83  85   The CRIC  which focuses on language development and renewal  is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples  Jackson 2003  82   It often stands in conflict with the AICO  its Guambiano counterpart  Jackson 2003  83 84   Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity  those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups  Jackson 2002  109   The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre colonial times  therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best  Rappaport 2005  2   This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities  both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other  In the 1990s the rhetoric of  cultural diversity  was picked up the Colombian media  and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public  thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole 
            A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991  which includes a section on indigenous rights  as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups  Gow and Rappaport 2002  57   Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty  While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups  it is now used to support them  resguardos  or communally owned plots of land  are granted to communities  They are ruled by the cabildo  local governing boards formed of community leaders  Gow and Rappaport 2002  51 52   The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity  no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse  communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era  The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law  and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature  Gow and Rappaport 2002  57 58  
            The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999  Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord  by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution  Warren 2002  157 158   It failed  despite the Mayan majority  possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations  Warren 2002  149  151   However  it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate  as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility  and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution  Warren 2002  159  172   Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself  those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone  England 2003  733   Nonetheless  in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages  which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language  recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion  While largely symbolic  it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish 
            This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia  Within the pan Mayan movement  there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity  some view the reduction of their language to the status of  dialect  devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world  however  despite differences over standardization  the pan Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive  In contrast  Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued  but serves to split the population  both between groups and within groups themselves  An example is the Tukanoans  while considered a single “ethnic group”  they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy  in which members of one language group must marry into another  Jackson 1995  4   
            Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture  Indigenous cosmology  or “cosmovision”  is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages  it maintains a concept of culture  defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature”  Gow and Rappaport 2002  58  and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought  Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed  often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non governmental organizations  The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves  the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with  It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level  however  with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve  Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships  tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony  crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community s harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime  but may have influenced the accused to do so  When a punishment   often public and corporal in nature   is carried out  the group feels the effects as a whole  Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence  sharing in their ordeal   Rappaport 2005  Once punishments are completed  the criminal is seen as rehabilitated  having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order  and is welcomed back into the community  Gow and Rappaport 2002  61  Rappaport 2005  97  
            Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task  as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision  The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms  as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution  but to recapture its spirit in a native  rather than Western discourse  Gow and Rappaport 2002  58 59   This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture  and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing  Rappaport 2005  93  236   Translation fulfills another vital role  as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself  Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge  distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries  The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature  Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten  Rappaport 2005  165  
            This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use  Difficulties arise  however  as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop  Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers  raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use  The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great  leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought  In addition  there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity  the Nasa  for example  divide themselves into the traditional  modern  and new  The authenticity of the modern Nasa  who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots  is brought into question by the traditional  who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence Rappaport 2005   In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility  years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one  and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so  Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya  thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions  which most often occurs under Spanish influence 
            A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”  both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture  The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”  it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse  leading to distrust among indigenous peoples  Jackson 2002  85   Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly  even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish  indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself  The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group  the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences  Efforts towards development  then  cannot endanger traditional culture and values  for fear of losing cultural legitimacy  Jackson 1995  5   There develops a duality in native culture  for example  many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom  An emphasis on preserving  rather than practicing  native culture arises  indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day to day basis  Gow and Rappaport 2002  66 67  
             This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed  In Guatemala  they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress  the pan Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law  In Colombia  legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government s recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights  by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife  and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not  Jackson 1995  8   Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status  indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws  Jackson 1995  5   Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment

            Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra  I 
            Drew F  Nobile
            University of Washington
            Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók  one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used  Bartók’s music  although it is often difficult to call completely tonal  never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure  This remains true even with one of his last compositions  the Concerto for Orchestra  written two years before his death in 1943  The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto  focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement  The analysis will treat the movement tonally  investigating the progression of local “tonics” and its relationship to the overall form  We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common practice compositional techniques 
            Harmonic Structure and Form
            Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form ”
                  Bartók  431 
                While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion  it is perfectly accurate  the movement is in sonata form  but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement  not unheard of in Mozart sonatas   and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order  The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates 
                  For example  the fifth string quartet  Also see Bartók’s comments on that  Bartók  414  
                Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement  the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction  As the example shows  the development section is divided into three subsections  the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group  and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition  Hence  on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG STG FTG which makes the overall form  with the exception of the Introduction  symmetric 
                  Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement  although his interpretation is somewhat different  See Wilson  168 170 
               
            
            || Intro | FTG | STG | Dev I  FTG  | Dev II  new  | Dev III  FTG  | STG | FTG ||
                  The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group  respectively 
               
            
            example 1  formal structure of the first movement
            Sonata form—or  “more or less” sonata form—carries harmonic as well as formal connotations  While “tonality” in this piece  and in Bartók’s music in general  is quite different from its classical interpretation  we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata form structure  To begin with  the movement is in F  When we say “in F ” we do not imply F major  or minor  for that matter —the major minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch class F is the tonal center of the movement  and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement  Using this interpretation  we can map out the local tonics  tonal centers  used throughout the movement  as shown in Example 2 
            
               
            
            example 2  harmonic structure of the first movement
            In this example  the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece  Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation —so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins  Beginning with the exposition  the large scale progression of tonal centers is a whole tone descent from F to F  represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2  while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯  shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph  in a quasi bass Anstieg  The middle pitch of the descent  B  acts as the “dominant” to F  based on its symmetrical division of the whole tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition  Bartók has often applied a tonic dominant relationship to a pitch class and its tritone partner  and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet 
                  See Bartók  414 415 
                In this particular movement  Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant  C  for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections 
            
               
            
            Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis  we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings  Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure  The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis  while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements  it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced  this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper 
            The Introduction
            As Paul Wilson points out  the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures 
                  Wilson  172 
                The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact  it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece  To begin with  the opening motive in the celli and basses  shown in Example 3  outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center  The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch class set  and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale  Indeed  this set can be seen more as a by product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself  The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement  and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive  Furthermore  the following two instances of this opening motive  shown in Examples 4 and 5  remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth  and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set

            example 5  measures 22 29  celli  basses and violas 
            Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯  and adds pitch class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3  creating a six note set of stacked fourths  Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth  the set created is a ten note set derived by stacking fourths 
                  If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example 
                Each note is either approached or left  or both  by a fourth  and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯  The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯  through F♯  these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭  E♭ and G♭  As previously mentioned  this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole tone descent from F to F  So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a  usually ascending  perfect fourth  We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths  indeed  the structural whole tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth  This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group  mm  155 233   and as we will see  it occurs in other places  though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2  
            Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths  the same sequence of intervals occurs  two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second   5   2   5   each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples  This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition  shown in measures 2 3 of Example 8  So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement  within the first 29 measures we can already see structural  harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole 
            The section from measures 35 50 is centered on E  upon the return of D♯  enharmonically respelled as E♭  in measure 58  we see that E acts as its upper neighbor  This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51 57 however  while there is no clear tonal center for this section  G appears in the outer voices in measure 51  although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor  The concluding motive of this section in the violins  the bracketed sections of Example 6   as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff   Example 7   are related to the first head motive of the first theme  which is shown in the first measure of Example 8  All three of these motives span a tritone  which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement  Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated ”
                  Wilson  173 
                but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition

            example 7  measure 58  violas  celli  basses   repeated through measure 75
            The Exposition
            Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition  nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears  The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over  As mentioned  the first theme  the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8  contains two head motives  the first is the tritone spanning ascent that appears in the first measure  and the second is an iteration of the interval cell   5   2   5  that appears in the second through third measures  While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter  the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation  Rather  this motive is a small scale representation of the tonic dominant relationship of tritone partners  specifically F and B  that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement 
            
               
            
            example 8  measures 76 80  violins 
            Rhythmically  we have a dissonance between the melody  which follows the written meter  and the accompanying chords in the bassoons  horns and lower strings  Example 9 reproduces the chords  and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern  As Example 10 shows  the chords are more or less in duple meter  4 8 and 2 8  with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5 8 measure  This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody  with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2 8 measures   As we will later see  this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation

            example 10  measures 77 91 rebarred to reflect rhythmic pattern
            We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset  both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77  While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76 94  these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F  E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95 134  although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131  Measures 95 130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭  where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass  Example 11 illustrates this structure  Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass  C♯  D♭  is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme  The trombone motive in measures 134 141  shown in Example 12  is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development  although its importance is downplayed here  Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯  which fills in the whole tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth  This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯ C♯ B E  with the addition of some passing tones   in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths

            Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition 
                  Wilson  174 
                While the strong V I motion from measures 90 91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant tonic  such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context  E♭  furthermore  is not convincingly established as a dominant functioning tone at all  The passage from measures 85 89 is centered on E♭  and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step   but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function  Rather  we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground level whole tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2  In measures 91 95  the bass descends F E♭ D♭ C  which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant  However  as previously mentioned  C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149 155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B  the “true” dominant  The descent in measures 91 95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C  which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger  This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning  a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge 
            The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple  which is in stark contrast to the first theme  B dominates as tonal center from measures 155 191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it  Measures 192 197 are in E♭  with the bass notes in the harp  and measures 198 209 are in D♭  A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole tone being “filled in” by a fourth  The return to B in measure 210 is also filled in in this way by F♯ in measures 208 209  Hence  measures 155 210 constitute the bass progression B E♭ D♭ B  the same stepwise descent  E♭ D♭  occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged  Paul Wilson points out that “ i n substituting for F within an analogous structure  B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement ”
                  Wilson  179 
                In our terminology  this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant 
            The Development
            As mentioned  the development is divided into three subsections  In Example 2  the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches  and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole tone descent  As Paul Wilson states  the development “is  for Bartók’s music  developmental in a relatively conventional way”  the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified  and tonalities other than those expected arise 
                  Wilson  180 
                The only slight abnormality  though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical period sonata movements  is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development  Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head motive of  the first theme  ”
                  Wilson  182 
                there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives  and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm  contour and interval content are changed  Furthermore  this section  being the middle section of the movement  upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme 
            The first section of the development  measures 231 271  begins with a big D minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section  Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239  it returns to D minor in measure 248  which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D  The passage beginning at measure 248  shown in Example 13  can be considered to be the “theme” of this section  and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme  This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section  While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261 264 as 6 Z50   014679    identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence   5   2   5  from the original motive 
            
               
            
            example 13  measures 248 264  violins 
            The second section of the development is in C♯  which is sometimes spelled D♭   This section is reproduced as Example 14  This section returns to the calm simplicity  and tempo  of the second section  though apart from affect there are no references to that section  Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293  preceded by A♭ major  V  in measure 285  suggests C♯ as tonal center  the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303  The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development  Example 15   which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯ 
                  Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group  we could conceive of C  as a sub dominant in this movement  As tempting as this interpretation may be  this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms

            example 14  measures 272 313  reduction   development  part 2
            The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12  transposed to begin on F  and turns it into a fugato sequence  reproduced in Example 17  The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316 318 by the strong V I chord progression  Example 16   As previously mentioned  the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme  The resultant set is the pentatonic set F B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭  the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set  The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth  but the first note is B♭ rather than C  which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set  and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center  
            
               
            
            example 16  measures 316 318  establishment of b♭
            The second instance of the fugato section  not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18  is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C  The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363  The following section  measures 363 389  especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set  so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation  Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A  which intensifies the arrival on A  and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large scale whole tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section

            example 18  measures 342 349  horns   inverted fugato subject
            The Recapitulation
            The recapitulation  as we have seen  presents the themes in reverse order  The second theme is initially presented in A  as part of the whole tone descent  and proceeds directly to G  where it is restated slightly modified  It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D  which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole step by the intervening fourth  The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area  but it leads to D in measure 444  which constitutes a V chord still applied to G  Rather than resolve this D back to G  however  Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467  E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme  measures 456 487  which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F  which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much anticipated recapitulation of the first theme 
            The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such  however  there are some important differences  Firstly  its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it  the first chord in Example 9 is an F minor triad  and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F minor scale  In the recapitulation of this theme  shown in Example 19  the first chord is an F major chord  and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody  In fact  the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I vi V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major  the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation   we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation 
            In addition to the “mode” shift  we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears  notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19  and also that the written meter no longer changes  In other words  the piece  in becoming more regular  is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure  the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement  Indeed  this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection  and the tonic harmony is active throughout  There are also no phrase divisions—the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514  where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V I cadence  signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes 
            
               
            
            example 19  measures 488 494  the first theme in the recapitulation
            
               
            
            There is no fine line between music that is “tonal” and music that is “atonal ” Bartók is one of the many early twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality  While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind  and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions  by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work  Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others  we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system  however  is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum  But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area  we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results  To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra  By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm  we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain  but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions  It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why

            Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color 
            The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White

            The world is made up of a myriad of colors  color gives distinction to our life  it
               gives flavor and meaning  What would our lives be without color? At the same time in
               our modern society  color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the
               enlightened mind and space  color is seen as corrupting  intoxicating  disorienting
               and in art  has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch  We went from
               times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white
               were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence 
               What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to
               high art? Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our
               space? What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more
               specifically can black and white be considered non colors? 
            Ever since the dawn of man  human society has evolved in ways which attempt to
               ultimately control nature  Seeing as color is something of the natural world  age
               old and archaic  washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above
               the physical world  “Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate
               sounds  organized beings  like all animals and vegetables  express themselves by
               cries or forms  contour or carriage  Inorganic nature has only the language of
               color  It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or
               emerald… color  then  is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature 
               while drawing becomes the medium of expression  more and more dominant  the higher we
               rise in the scale of being” Blanc  Chromophobia  p 25   The history of color is
               about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the
               ages  
            In the Far East  reaching a state of colorless ness is associated with the highest
               state of spiritual being  the state of Zen  What is typical of this sort of ascetism
               is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal  This is
               apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and
               Japan  For them  reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in
               its most minimal form  This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the
               artist had reached within himself  it was a means of reducing down to the essence of
               a thing  
            In the Elimination of color in the Far East  Izutsu explains though how this
               ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine
               knowledge of color  “This artistic acestism  i e   the suppression of externals and
               the reduction of all colors to black and white  manifests its real aesthetic
               function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and
               their subtle hues  In other words  the true profundity of the beauty of black and
               white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of
               sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints” Izutsu  p 
               169   For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of
               color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors
               in themselves as non colors  
            It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no
               longer present  It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space  Without color one
               could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space  colorlessness needs
               color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place  “That is to say 
               under the total absence of color  there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that
               have been “killed” Izutsu  p  177   Black and white are the consummation of all
               colors into one  “Black is life  it is the infinite possibility of expression and
               development  Black here is not sheer black  For in it’s negation of all colors  all
               colors are positively affirmed” Izutsu  p  193   It is through these means that one
               finds the essence in a thing  
            In Western society  this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of
               generations past  Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the
               18th century  Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life  representing
               modernity  color became a moral issue  seen as something sensuous and dangerous in
               its secondary nature to the essence of life and form  “The predominance of color at
               the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute  of fleeting
               appearance over permanent form  of physical impression over the empire of the
               soul” Chromophobia  p  28   color rests on the surface of an object  it is
               superficial  cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that
               thing  
            color is associated with the Fall from Grace  It is something which speaks to the
               senses  not the mind  it is external and therefore secondary to life  It deals with
               the body  emotions  not the intellect  It strays from reason in the way which it
               consumes and manipulates life  “color was a permanent internal threat  an
               ever present inner other which  if unleashed  would be the ruin of everything  the
               fall of culture  For  Charles Blanc  color also represents a kind of ruination 
               color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization  the
               nobility of the human spirit  slowly  heroically  has lifted itself – but back into
               which it could always slide” Chromophobia  p  23   It is a descent in the way it
               makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire  and to
               desire is to lose control over oneself  Thus  began the cult of the black and white  
            White is seen as representing spirituality  the heavens  and light  it is all which
               is modern  it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color  It is the
               control of nature  and the body and represents the modern man  
            “WHITE is the spiritual color of our times  the clearness which directs all out
               actions  It is neither grey white  nor vory white  but pure white  
            WHITE is the color of modern times  the color which dissipates a whole era  our era
               is perfection  purity  certitude 
            WHITE It includes everything 
            We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of
               divisionism  the cult of the blue ky  the gods with green beards and the
               spectrum 
            WHITE pure white ” Chromophobia  p  47   
            For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of
               colors  Abolishing color means controlling color  “The white surface exposes
               color  presents it for disciplining  It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames 
               But before that  it keeps an eye on itself  watching its freshly laundered and neatly
               folded fabric for the stain of color” Wigly  p  151   colorlessness is not natural 
               and thus proves man’s superiority over this world  
            On the other hand  we need color in order to distinguish black and white  Just as
               those from the Far East  the purity of white implies what has been washed away and
               thus makes the white glitter even more  White and black stand out because of color 
               and color stand out because of white and black  They are linked intrinsically
               together  one cannot go without the other  “White is the setting for color   In a
               mosque for example  the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a
               strategic use of color  “All these things are clothed in a majestic coat of
               whitewash  The forms stand out clearly  the impeccable construction displays all its
               boldness  At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration ”
               The sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it
               marks” Wigley  p  209   We need this opposition between color and ‘non color’ to make
               distinction between the two  otherwise neither would hold such significance  White
               helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash  it brings together and unites 
               “White expresses a certain incorporeality  The use of white is therefore decisive for
               the bodily appearance of a space  Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less
               depending on their color value  Against white  one can actually establish the
               intensity of clashing colors  white determines the tone in the first place  Because
               of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize” Wigley 
               p  311   
            For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and
               architectural spaces  The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set
               before them  It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours
               of the space  “In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and
               disposition was surest and most convincing  all the details of the form and color of
               the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a
               form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could
               be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed”
               spaces” Wigley  p  313   
            There is another important aspect which white is representative of  and that is the
               well educated and socially elite  In the 19th century it became fashionable for
               bourgeois women to dress in white  while men dressed in black  Wigley   These
               distinctions proved a certain rational order  only attained by those able to afford
               of it  White walls  white clothing  they both require much more maintenance than
               something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors  Crisp
               whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury  and leisure  White clothing
               proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work 
               for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women
               who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white  while men who were the ones
               to go out and work wore black  for black did in fact hide stains  
            The same goes with white walls  in their impeccability it proved to whoever  that the
               owner could afford to not live actually live in this space  or could afford more
               simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint  Both as well were signs of
               the modern age man had reached  “Pure white was de rigueur  partly because of its
               exciting novelty  partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture  and
               pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature” Wigley  p  xvii   The use of
               white was proof that man had conquered nature  
            The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of
               distinguishing oneself from the vulgar  normal  lower classes  “  it is also worthy
               of remark  that savage nations  uneducated people  and children have a great
               predilection for vivid colors  that animals are excited to rage by certain colors 
               that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are
               about them  and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their
               presence” Chromophobia  p  112   Furthermore  with the advent of industrialization
               the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for
               all classes  Now  anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began
               to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them  
            Thus said  the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new
               bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the
               vulgarity from the low  “In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie  there
               long survived a tendency to limit the use of color  with strong emphasis on what are
               generally thought of as non colors  such as white  black and gray” The Style Engine 
               p  40   Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in
               black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession
               with purity and cleanliness  Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of
               labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society  the wearing
               of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so  This simplicity of dress
               was seen as a mark of the modern man  
            Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on
               this preference for black and white  Photography took over as a means of portraiture
               for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to
               color the photographs  for the most part they were left in black and white because it
               was seen as more “natural”  Above all  it is believed that the expanse of literacy
               and the printed word  mainly the newspaper  had a profound effect in influencing the
               choice of black and white  “This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform 
               a world in “black and white”  This led to the idea of writing   rationality  
               production that confined images  especially images in color  to the emerging field of
               “art”  which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially
               unproductive  while it assigned to the two toned and orderly world of printed paper
               the role of a daily guide to existence” The Style Engine  p  42   The world of print
               was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man  
            Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and
               technology  This then translated down into the world of fashion  as seen with the
               distinction between black and white clothing  as well as art  namely photography but
               also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space  
            Seeing as since the time of Aristotle  form was valued over that of color  the arts
               which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form 
               The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful
               advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch  “Kitsch is a product
               of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America
               and established what is called universal literacy” Greenberg   In order to meet the
               demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the
               attention of consumers  Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it
               reproduced it d infinitum  Greenberg continues by saying  “Kitsch  using for raw
               material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture  welcomes and
               cultivates this insensibility  It is the source of its profits  Kitsch is mechanical
               and operates by formulas  Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations  Kitsch
               changes according to style  but remains always the same  Kitsch is the epitome of all
               that is spurious in the life of our times  Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its
               customers except their money    not even their time”  With the advent of kitsch came
               a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms  Avant guard at
               the time was considered to be true art  while this kitsch was simply pure imitation  
            Thus said  this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the
               cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious  high art 
               while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes 
               Of course during the early stages of color film and photography  the quality was so
               poor that it gave a cheap look  whereas black and white film really allowed one to
               see the light and the shadows in the images  For the play of light and form was key
               in demonstrating the true art form  That was what made up the essence of an image 
               not the artificial  or superficial filling in of form with color  Color was thought
               to distract the viewer from the soul of the image  
            These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being
               almost better than reality  Still though black and white is seen as something of a
               more sober tradition  Photographers still use black and white and white is still the
               most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces  These non colors allow for
               the appreciation of color  When something is black and white  it allows the mind to
               fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen 
               Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the
               mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them  It is for
               this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an
               intellectual process  It forces one to imagine  it forces one to delve into the core
               of the object  Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non
               color  the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years 
               Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color  but perhaps it
               is human instinct  to want to surpass and rebel against generations before  so
               possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration  Thus is the ebb and
               flow of life

            September 19  1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown  Ohio will ever forget  On that date Jennings
            Lambeth  president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company  announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell
            Works would close  Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback  for the people
            of Youngstown and the surrounding area  it meant disaster  Mahoning County was a one industry area  and the
            people of Youngstown  Struthers  Campbell  Boardman Township  and the numerous other small towns and
            villages in the area only had one main employer  the steel mills  
            The events that would follow this
            date  known as Black Monday  are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage
            and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope  Rather than sit back and wait for their
            jobs to be snatched away  the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able
            to keep the factories open  Petitions  protests  rallies  collectivization  and even the takeover of a steel
            company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the
            only source of employment that this town had  These well intentioned efforts ultimately failed  leaving
            thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind  
            But why did the
            brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail? When
            examining the area’s history  culture  and economic situation we can identify four main reasons  the refusal
            of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown
            branch  the lagging international steel market  the lack of a clear  organized vision for individual
            initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign  and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between
            different small towns in the region  all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union
            leaders to save the industry  Most importantly  the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem  Although
            it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions  the local people simply
            could not solve a national crisis on a local level  
            
            A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio

In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as
Poland Township  Their blast furnace  “Hopewell ” was the very first blast furnace in the area  During the Civil War 
Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products  Youngstown also was a major railway
crossroads  due to its strategic position between Cleveland  Pittsburgh  New York  and Chicago  In fact  “More rail
cars passed under the Center Street Bridge  a major bridge in Youngstown  per day than any other location in the
country ”

During the 19th century  the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast
 Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania  to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast  including the Mahoning
Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky  By 1880  Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16 000 
which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty year period  The town continued to prosper  driven by the flux of
immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills  This prosperity continued until the late 1920s  when
the Great Depression hit the area hard  Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to
establish a national steel workers’ union  the industry barely survived the Depression years  Finally  the outbreak of
the Second World War made iron and steel important again  and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill
into a fast paced period of booming growth 

Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post war period  but the seeds for its downfall
were slowly being sown  Strikes racked the town during the forties  fifties  and sixties  and they were often long and
bloody  In 1973  the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed  This prohibited strikes and lockout  angering
workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down  At the same time  stricter governmental standards for
environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel
parts  and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie 
Most importantly  Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive  Old technology was
not replaced  obsolete methods were not updated  and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help
modernize  It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and
their families 

Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry
The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral  which would send the
entire valley into chaos and ruin  Between 1977 and 1981  a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25 000
jobs were lost countywide  Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade
the powers that be to reconsider their statement  However  it was clear that  in the words of USWA president Lloyd
McBride  “If you can’t make a buck  you get out of the business ”


The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry  the end of its population growth  and then end of
economic progress  Without the mills  people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas
of the country  Those that could afford to move did so  those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the
streets  Without an industrial or a residential base  commerce shrank considerably  It was becoming increasingly clear
that without the industrial base provided by the mills  the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town  inhabited
by those too poor or hopeful to escape  The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city  and so they
mobilized in a variety of ways 

Attempts to Save the Mills

The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown ” says Ed Mann  a local
union leader and organizer   The petition was circulated  eventually including thousands of signatures  it was then
given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington  However  the representatives were shunted to
the side and ignored in Washington  since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry 

The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power  but they refused to support the local union
members  The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure 

Next  workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition  an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded
the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works  The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of
workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively  Lykes ignored the letters  so the Coalition turned once again
to the federal government  Here  too  they were ignored  The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills  so they
could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed  
Finally  following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980  local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel
Headquarters in Youngstown  They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene  then charged the
Headquarters and took it over  The workers stayed there until the next day  when US Steel declared that they were ready
to talk about selling the mill  Immediately after the workers left the building  US steel representatives told the local
union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the
mill 

All these efforts eventually came to nothing  and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed  These attempts to save
the mills were hindered by several major factors  including the decline of the world steel market  which made American
steel impossible to sell or export 

The Decline of the World Market
The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up  During
World War II the rest of the world was hungry for America’s iron and steel products  however  by the seventies no
foreign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities  In fact  American steel imports were beginning to
outweigh exports 

Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make  and was often of higher quality than domestic steel  Foreign
steel companies invested in their factories  updating their technology and replacing their equipment often  This meant
that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America  and therefore were able to export a
more competitive product 

Foreign steel was also much cheaper  Wage hikes  although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers
in the US  made American steel far more expensive  Also  international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap
labor  Jobs were scarce in other steel exporting countries  and labor laws were either non existent or allowed employers
to pay much less for work  Labor costs in America continued to go up  draining US companies of their resources  while
companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities 

On a worldwide scale  newer materials such as aluminum  plastic  and composites were beginning to substitute steel
both at home and abroad  Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline  and it affected both domestic and foreign
companies  However  to American companies already suffering financial setbacks  outdated machinery  and fierce
competition  this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford  America’s steel remained unsold  flooding
the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy 

Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one  the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were
not unique  Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry  but it was not
alone  The problem was a national one  involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone  J  Philip Richley 
a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills  has summed it up thus  “You just can’t solve a
nation wide problem in a single city ” The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the
entire steel community in America  Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that
spread throughout the entire industry 

The Save Our Valley Campaign  Lack of Funds and Plans
Eventually  some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and
former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign  As the name suggests  local leaders wanted to
instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency  driving them forward to confront steel companies and
owners and help secure the future of the region  Marches  speeches  and letter writing were all employed to help
stimulate the Campaign and rally the people 
But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding  The people of Youngstown  being now
unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive  College tuition  clothes  food  and heating all
had to come before donations to non profit organizations  People outside of the area had no personal investment in the
mills  and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds  The lack of money proved
to be crippling  because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively  Without
funds  the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy 

The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component  an actual concrete plan  No one seemed to know
just how to go about fixing the problems  Letters and petitions were all very well  but they did little to improve the
situation  People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization  but no one could really fathom exactly how that would
work  the people of Youngstown were  after all  not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general 
Beyond that  no one knew how they should proceed  everyone knew that saving the mills was important  but nobody stepped
forward with a full fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down 
Without a real plan  nothing could truly be achieved 

Without funds to drive the efforts  or even a real plan of action  the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than
good  In effect  it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything  People became excited
and waited for the mills to reappear  but they never did  The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was
plunged into economic chaos 

The Apathy of USWA

United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit 
Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs  However  it
soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight  the international branch was not  The
higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight  attempting to shut out the
appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening 

Actually  one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do  No one
had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before  and none of the leaders of USWA  not even president Lynn
Williams  knew what could be done  It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings
would be one of the worst in US history  and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered  Rather
than try and come up with some sort of scenario  the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown  hoping that
perhaps the problem would resolve itself  or at least not spread any further than it already had 

Besides incompetence  the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart  fear of socialism 
Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action  but they worried that the federal government might see
the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism  If the
USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories  then the
government  and potentially other important people and institutions as well  might begin to think that the UWSA leaders
were encouraging socialism  This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its
people  something they could not afford to do  Therefore  they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch
fight it out alone 

Regionalism

From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets  Youngstown is the
name of the major city area  but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are
indistinguishable from the main city itself  Boardman  Poland Township  Struthers  Lowellville  Warren  Lordstown 
Canfield  Niles  and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown  see Figure 3   People from each town
work  shop  eat  and socialize in towns separate from their own  making each town strongly dependent on every other
town  However  although traffic is heavy between each separate district  each area has its own distinct cultural
ethnicity  educational system  heritage  history  and even food  For example  Struthers is a poor town with a large
Slovak population  where education is generally better than in surrounding towns  but unemployment is much higher and
pollution is widespread  Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist  Two blocks over one finds Boardman  a
well off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools  Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman
Catholic  with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side  Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding
towns  and the streets are clean and well kept  With many more cultures  religions  and economic levels living in close
proximity to one another  a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area  regionalism  Each town  with their own identity 
instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations  which dictates many habits  exchanges  and
interactions between populations  Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred  with certain
towns becoming sworn enemies of others 

With so much regional tension  it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause  even one that would
save their jobs and their futures  Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from
Campbell  and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman  even if they were supposed to be
working towards the same thing  A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement  because no one was
willing to put aside regional differences to work together  In some instances  small companies would express interest in
helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area  but because of regional pride no one could ever agree
where the new businesses should relocate  In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for
new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional
pride 

Conclusion  The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday
 
Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people  The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact
were unsuccessful for four main reasons  the failure of the international steel market  the lack of funds and plans in
initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign  the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of
ineptitude and fear  and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope
for brining in new companies 

What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level  and perhaps it
is not  But to the thousands of people living there  the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves
through their economic  political  and social futures  Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence  hundreds of
people were uprooted  forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities  Hundreds more joined the unemployment
lines  or even began living on the streets  For the people of Youngstown  Black Monday was not just a historical event 
it was the most important event in their lives 


The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves  something
which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on  Even though they eventually failed  the fact that they
tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives
and the futures of their children

            Madame White Snake  East Asian Femme Fatale of Old
            The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake  the snake demon that takes human form and
               becomes the wife of a man  has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales
               and fiction for centuries  Two quintessential novellas  “The Lust of the White
               Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal
               Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story  are both relatively
               complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a
               more believable human  but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal 
               While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of
               this femme fatale  the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme
               fatale’s transgressive behavior  not her eventual punishment for it 
            Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty  and
               initially her portrayal was fairly direct  as a villainous demon who drains the life
               force out of her human husband 
                  Lai  Whalen   From Folklore to Literate Theater  Unpacking  Madame White
                     Snake    Asian Folklore Studies 51  no  1  1992   52 
                But over time  characterizations of her became more complex  and the persona
               of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic  and perhaps even a model of the ideal
               Confucian wife  particularly in “Pagoda”  Whalen Lai notes  “She was a loving wife  a
               caring mother  rescuer of her family from the first flood  and  at that point  a
               general benefactor of man  She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female 
               particularly forbearance” 
                  Ibid   53 
                But if she were really an ideal wife  why could she not live happily with her
               human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key 
            Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre modern
               Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian
               wife  since it is primarily associated with film characters  particularly those of
               the film noir genre  But this term  which is relatively speaking  a neologism  The
               earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century
                  Oxford English Dictionary  “Femme  ” Oxford University Press

                  is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her
               incarnations  It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive  and lures men to
               their downfall with her sexual attractiveness  In both incarnations of Madame White
               snake  the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful  Toyoo  her human lover in
               “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and
               dreams of her  and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal
                  beauty” 
                  Ueda  Akinari  Ugetsu Monogatari   Tales of Moonlight and Rain   A Complete

                     162 164 
                In “Eternal Prisoner ” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her
               lover Hsü into his dreams  and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could
               not concentrate on doing business ”
                  “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda ” Trans  Diana Yu  in Y  W  Ma

                     Boston  Zheng & Zui Co  1986  358 
                Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty  suggesting
               that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction 
            In addition to distracting sexuality  the irregular characterization of Madame White
               Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir
               femme fatale  In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective 
               Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman
               is honest or a deceiver  but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so
               that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the  femme fatale 
               stereotype or not” 
                  Christine Gledhill  “Klute 1  A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism ”
                     in Feminism and Film  ed  E  Ann Kaplan  New York  Oxford University Press 
                     2004   81 
                While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently
               within their narratives  the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the
               evolution of her character over time  readers may not be sure whether she is a pure
               villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society  because
               there is evidence of both throughout her legend  She is a loyal wife to her husband
               as she has promised  but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and
               deceives him about her supernatural nature 
            The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent
               of these stories  A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame
               White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man 
               and she must be defeated and punished by society  This is quite similar to the
               expected end for the femme fatal character in films   she is punished in some way so
               that social order and proper gender roles are restored  In both stories  Madame White
               Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her  and she is eventually
               rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda  Her husband becomes a monk  and this
               further implicates Lady White Snake  this time from a Buddhist perspective  Female
               beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them
               from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana  Furthermore  Lady White Snake’s
               lover is far from the ideal man  He is weak willed and not particularly useful  In
               “Lust ” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks
               and tempted you  But you  yourself  owing to a lack of courage and spirit  fell
               victim to their temporary form” 
                  Ugetsu Monogatari  177 178 
                 The implications of this are that a stronger  more capable man would not
               fall for the Lady’s trickery  But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere?
               If they were  Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil
               character 
            Instead  both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy
               for her  despite her depraved sexuality  Certainly  readers admire her patience and
               loyalty  “I searched everywhere  and now that at last I’ve found you  I’m very
                  happy ”
                  Ibid  173 
                she gushes to him in “Lust ” Readers must also acknowledge that her human
               lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her  She pleads with him  “We
               have a love bond between us  as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea 
               and we must live and die together  Please  since we are already married  take me
               back  and let’s stay together the rest of our lives  Wouldn’t that be
                  wonderful?”
                  “Eternal Prisoner ” 369 
                In another traditional vernacular story  “Tsu Shih Niang Sinks the Jewel Box
               in Anger 
                  “Tu Shih Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger ” trans  Richard M  W  Ho  in Y  W 
                     Ma and Joseph S  M  Lau  Traditional Chinese Stories   Themes and Variations 
                     Boston  Zheng & Zui Co  1986  358 
               ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover  and
               suffers for it  suggesting that traditionally  loyalty and keeping ones word was
               valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s  So her husband’s failure to follow
               through on his end of the bargain  completely forgetting the love he once had for
               her  makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight  
            However  no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers  the
               story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda  These stories draw from the long
               tradition of supernatural and ghost stories  which usually end with the demon
               destroyed or at least subdued  In the initial versions of this story Madame White
               Snake harmed her human lover  so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or
               later  a Buddhist monk
                  Lai  53 
                would have been a satisfying ending  Readers of early versions of the story
               might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty  and
               would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her
               crushing defeat  Conversely  the authors of the two stories examined here do not give
               readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake  so the pleasure of
               the narrative   to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory   comes not from the
               death of the insubordinate  disruptive force  from watching the transgressions
               themselves  
            In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir  Janey Place argues that the
               strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly
               imparted by their morals at the end  She writes  “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth
               often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic  strong 
               unrepressed  if destructive  woman ”

                      London  British Film Institute  2003   48 
                In these two stories  the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on
               in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda  but the
               sexy  aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover  
            This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints  since it
               is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these
               stories  However  consciously or unconsciously  these authors created a female
               character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine  In fact  Communists in
               the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against
               the patriarchy 
                  Lai  52 
                Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine
               in her own right  rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist  so too
               Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly
               outside the bounds of conventional social expectations  
         
      
   







A defense of Michael Moore and  Bowling for Columbine   Op Ed By Eloquence Wed Aug 13th  2003 at 09 00 09 AM EST 

This is an open letter to David Hardy  author of Bowling for Columbine  Documentary or Fiction?  probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar winning documentary  Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award  Their chances are small  however  as their arguments rely on polemic  exaggeration and misrepresentation    in other words  on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using  
Dear David Hardy  
It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary  In a time of simple minded patriotism  loud  clear and dissenting voices like Mr  Moore s are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced  partially through well funded public relations campaigns  partially through conservative  grass roots  propaganda  Not surprisingly  much of the criticism of Moore s film is misguided or outright wrong  often vastly more inaccurate than Moore s work itself  

Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical  dishonest organization  he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence  and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem  His documentary is full of subtle humor  jaw dropping dialogue and dark contrasts  All in all  it is an accurate portrayal of America s gun and violence culture  It also raises questions about America s foreign policy of recent decades  questions which have been all but ignored by Moore s critics  
On your webpage  you state that  Moore s resolution is questionable  After all  early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence    because Canadians like  and Japanese positively love  those  If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence    then how can newscasts about violence do so?  
This is a faulty generalization  If  as Moore implies  although never states as fact   video games and violent movies are relatively harmless  it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless  There is a huge difference  for example  between playing a game like  Quake  and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now  The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994  which killed 800 000 people  Similarly  the main motivation for the crusades  beyond the promise of wealth  was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved  
Obviously  media propaganda can incite people to kill  Interactive fiction like video games  on the other hand  presents violence in a narrative context  which may very well desensitize participants to said violence  but no causative link has ever been proven  Moore s hypothesis  which apparently comes at least in part from the book  Culture of Fear  by Barry Glassner  also advertised on Moore s website  is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia  which itself can lead to violent acts  This is consistent with the kind of media incited violence described above  and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence  It is no surprise  however  that US  and European  media do not question their own propaganda of fear  
Moore s second hypothesis is that America s foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts  a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists  Children who grow up in war torn regions are known for having similar views    war is perceived as a normal part of existence  violence as a natural way to solve disputes  In a weaker sense  the same message is projected to American children  who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another  but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how  the enemies of freedom  are punished  Moore s film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV  Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show  
 They squealed like little piggies too  so you ll have to make do with  oink  oink  squeeeeeeeallll  for their last words  That goes for your grandson Mustafa too  by the way  Still think fucking with the U S  was a good idea  Sammy?  
Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed  Americans cheer the killing of children  yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations  It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore s film seeks to address  
Inaccuracies 
Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore s movies  It is true that Moore s film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive  but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme  It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades  Let s look at some specific criticisms  
1  The bank scene  listed on your website on a separate page  Critics have stated that this scene was  staged   but in the bank interview  the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time  It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal  linked from your site  an employee claims that the gun would have been  normally  picked up at another dealer  It is not explained what  normally  is supposed to mean  but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film  This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes  but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore  
The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe  According to the same WSJ interview   Typically  you re looking at a week to 10 days waiting period   This is plausible    but entirely irrelevant for the movie  which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed  Moore s detractors have sometimes extended those 7 10 days to several weeks  contradicting the bank s own estimate  
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene  The bank does exactly what it advertises  It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account  The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation  a bank handing out guns to its customers  higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious  
2  The Lockheed Martin interview  This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often  and it also the most inaccurate  First  the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly  The dialogue goes as follows  
Moore   So you don t think our kids say to themselves  gee  dad goes off to the factory every day   he builds missiles  These are weapons of mass destruction  What s the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?  
McCollum  PR person    I guess I don t see that specific connection because the missiles that you re talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us   
First  note the word  our  in Moore s question  Moore is not from Colorado    his question is generic  not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question  McCollum understands it this way    otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized  However  critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum s response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant  
Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible  In response to one Moore detractor  McCollum wrote   Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U S   we make no weapons at the Littleton area facility Moore visited   Of course  critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military  and that the company is the nation s largest military contractor  As Moore correctly points out  it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons  but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence    children learn by imitating adults  
Yes  Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant    but he makes no incorrect statement  It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication  but in doing so  they themselves have  unlike Moore  made many incorrect claims  
3  Denver NRA meeting  Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards  
First  the  from my cold  dead hands  part  This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston  It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes  shown on national TV even here in Germany  It tells viewers  Aha  this is the person we are talking about  Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver  and in fact  their reptition later in the movie at another occasion  oddly claimed by critics to be again  misattributed   is simply a reminder of this  It is Moore s way to say  Viewers  meet Charlton Heston  gun nut extraordinaire  
The  visual of a billboard and a narration  is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together  when in reality  it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver  Moore is a professional filmmaker    he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites  and to accomplish that effect  uses subtle interludes instead of long winded introductions  This is a common technique  but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking  they believe critics who claim that he is  distorting  the interview  What he does is standard filmmaking practice  
The same goes for the interview which follows  Moore s critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety  have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of  balance   The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so  They were right  You claim that there was  no way to change location  since you have to give advance notice of that to the members  and there were upwards of 4 000 000 members   10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date  had the NRA really wanted to  It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money  not to piss off the victims of Colubmine  That does not change the fact that they did just that  Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff  This is what good documentary filmmaking is about  And here the critics again ignore important evidence  
When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver  the crowd boos loudly  Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor s letter  only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request    not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!   This booing by the crowd  not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article  shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there    and they effectively said  Fuck you   To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore s critics  
4  The Kayla Rolland case  Again  critics like yourself charge Moore with deception  The rally took place on October 17  the shooting on February 29  Again  standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion   Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum    with completely false ideas  It is brilliantly  if unethically  done   As noted above  the  from my cold dead hands  part is simply Moore s way to introduce Heston  Did anyone but Moore s critics view it as anything else? He certainly does not  attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered  and  as noted above  doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is  
Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland  you write   There is no indication that  Heston  recognized Kayla Rolland s case   This is naive to the extreme    Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence  Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview  he certainly knew about the case at that point  
Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase  48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead   This is one valid criticism  but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be  rather  it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore s fast pace editing  The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there  as will become quite obvious   but simply to highlight the first mention of the name  Kayla Rolland  in the text  which is in this paragraph  
Unfortunately  because the zooming is rather fast  it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence  so as you correctly note  some viewers got an incorrect impression  It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website  However  the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons  
a  Moore clearly states that  before he came to Flint   Heston gave an interview  In the excerpt from said interview  we can see that it is from March  If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers  why would he say this  and show the month the interview was published? 
b  Why should Moore leave the words  Clinton is on the Today Show  visible in the text  which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing  
c  Both the  soccer mom  interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact  The camera lingers on Bush Cheney posters  and the protestor is quoted as saying that  we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven t forgotten about Kayla Rolland   You make the hysterical claim that the interview  may be faked   on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee   but if Moore had faked it  why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor s mouth  which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla s death? Why did Moore  the masterful deveiver  not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense  
Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation s youngest school shooting months after the fact  but this sequence of  Bowling  is without doubt the most unfair to Heston  The claims of deliberate distortion don t hold up when viewing the whole scene  though    as  Hanlon s Razor  states  one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence  The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions  which is unfortunate  but Moore s critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly  Had they done so  Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe  In any case  at no point does Moore make a false statement  in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is  full of lies   
5  You write   Having created the desired impression  Moore follows with his Heston interview   No  he doesn t  You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology  yet you have no problems changing it yourself  The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie  After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston  where he is asked about Kayla Rolland  again  clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA s presence   then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch  entirely ignored by critics of the film  who also mentions Heston s presence as notable  and refers to the immediate reactions of  people from all over America   gun owners groups who  according to him  reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children  much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating  These people do not feel the need to express sympathy  or to think about ways to avoid such incidents  but they feel the need to assert their  rights  and to look for quick  simple answers    as Busch states  gun owners wanted to  hang  the child  from the highest tree   This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore s movie  who claim to be objective  
Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore s film is your sub essay  Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?  
Moore answers a simple question    how could the scene have been filmed    with a simple answer  two cameras  From this  you construct an obscure conspiracy of  re enactment    For all we can tell  Moore could have shouted  Hey!  to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left   Even if your  re enactment  theory is true  and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion   this itself is not unethical  and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here  just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview  You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader  without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion  
6 Animated history of the US  Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified  and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film  But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely  That the strategy to promote  gun rights  for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish  Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it  But if they didn t  one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK  This is the key message of this part of the animation  which is again being ignored by its critics  
7  Buell shooting in Flint  You write   Fact  The little boy was the class thug  already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil  and had fought with Kayla the day before   This characterization of a six year old as a pencil stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore s film warns against  It is the typical right wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset  The kid was a little bastard  and the parents were involved in drugs    case closed  But why do people deal with drugs? Because it s so much fun to do so? It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American  contras  
It is equally well known that the so called  war on drugs  begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population  both in relative and absolute numbers   
In poor areas  the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort  But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves  but poverty and the  war on drugs   
Had the boy s mother not been shipped to a  welfare to work  program  she might at least have had some time to spend with her son  Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities  the awareness of the consequences of one s actions  and the learning of conflict resolution by non violent means  Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program  knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring  Once again  your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore s  and Busch s  assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes  
That s because while there is a so called war on drugs  there is no war on poverty  Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural  and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR owners who are just too lazy to work  
In reality  what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen  to the detriment of families  
It is notable that the Wall Street Journal s reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours  It called Moore s claim  preposterous   How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens? 
8  Taliban and American aid  After the September 11 attacks  it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour  Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001  Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation  but because of the Taliban s violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies  Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords  it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid    the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage  Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq s Saddam Hussein  Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal  Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore s website about the film  
9  Gun homicides  Statistics are Moore s weakest point  and it is surprising that his critics don t dwell on them longer  That s because they know all too well that Moore is correct  The United States have a far greater homicide rate  both gun  and non gun  than most other first world countries  His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data  his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources  and  as you correctly point out  he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries   A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite com website  
Not surprisingly  guncite  too  compares data from different years    as I know from personal experience  it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology  The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned  according to guncite  are  
Japan  0 02 per 100 000  1994 England Wales  0 11 per 100 000  1997 Germany  0 22 per 100 000  1994 Australia  0 44 per 100 000  1994 United States  3 72 per 100 000  1999 
Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make    concluding that gun ownership  leads  to violence  In fact  Moore mentions several counter examples  and more such counter examples can indeed be cited  It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence    but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly  It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John  Mary  Lott  
The gun control movement  on the other hand  distracts from the real causes of violence    poverty  paranoia  the  war on drugs  and antisexuality  If these causes were addressed  gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem  but also unnecessary   just like it is in Switzerland  
10  Canada ammunition purchase  You write  
Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart  He asks us to  look at what I  a foreign citizen  was able to do at a local Canadian Wal Mart   He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised   That s right  I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted  in Canada  Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal  
Once again  you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and  faking   a word which  Canadian officials  have never used  for such a distortion  Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics   If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson  there is nothing fraudulent about that  He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification  His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim  
11  Heston s allegedly implied racism  You conclude from Heston s own words that Heston was somehow portrayed as racist  If anything  it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with  having a more mixed ethnicity   Heston s answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful  While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition  if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA  he should not be their spokesman  In this case  Hanlon s Razor can be applied to Heston    he is probably not racist  but incompetent  Your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported    in fact  it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which Moore asks Heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the States  and the point when he mentions the Kayla Rolland incident  If Heston makes himself look like a fool  that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore  
Conclusion 
You write   Bowling for Columbine is dishonest  It is fraudulent  To trash Heston  it even uses the audio video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give  and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer s mind to a wrong conclusion   None of this is true  What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries  one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture  It is not a flawless diamond    the  48 hours  scene in particular suffers from bad editing  the statistics are suboptimal  and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves  Other than towards the NRA  the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions  and comes up with some thoughtful answers  The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics  Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film  he would have used other material  photos from America s Emergency Rooms  
Certainly  Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today  and his film fully deserved its Oscar  The shrill  and remarkably unsuccessful  Internet campaign to  revoke  his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film s accuracy  It is not only the highest grossing non music documentary of all time  among the users of the largest Internet film database  IMDB  it is also the highest rated one  According to the LA Times  the documentary genre  owes a huge debt to Michael Moore     after Bowling s success  films like  Spellbound  and  Capturing the Friedmans  were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely  
But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason  His next project has the working title  Fahrenheit 9 11  The temperature at which freedom burns   and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election  It is unlikely  however  that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact  After all  the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record holding documentary   Roger & Me  by Michael Moore  
Yours sincerely

>Hotel California

Fact  Sound is a vibration  Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium  and in space  there is no
medium  So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn t keep the air in  I heard nothing  After the
first whoosh of the air being sucked away  there was lightning  but no thunder  Eyes bulging in
panic  but no screams  Quiet and peaceful  right? Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter
about his girl back on Earth and that all expenses paid vacation for two she won last time he was on leave  I
swore  if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again  giving the camera a cheesy thumbs up
from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches  I d kiss a monkey  Metaphorically  of course 

Fact  If  before all the air is sucked out of the ship  a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself
into a space suit  that person has less than twenty four hours to live  This is more than the person would have
sans space suit  Me  I found a space suit  but it was statistically unlikely that I  and whomever else has
followed suit  pun intended   would manage to repair our ship before the less than twenty four hours are up 
yes  studies have been done  So  twenty four hours  Give or take 

About the time I was composing my last words in my head  trying not to think too much about what suffocating
felt like  that s when I heard a bell 

My first thought  I was going crazy  Twenty four hours of silence  vacuum  remember   was I hallucinating
noises now?

I heard it again  It was a fine bell  reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I d
seen in documentaries  And accompanying the bell  I saw a light 

Now  there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense  First  the whole in a vacuum
why s there a bell thing  Second  I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship  and any conceivable
light sources were not within view  starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less
bright 

These signals were the heralds of my saviors 

The first words they said to me meant nothing  I wasn t listening  I didn t care  I was going to live  I was
going to keep breathing  Next to those  nothing else mattered  The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth  and
all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life giving substances and how breathing was like
sex  only better   I reserved the right to revise this opinion later  

When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue  I looked around  The ship  it was odd and
old  either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn t tell what make it was  and somehow  the crew
standing around me fit the same description  a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk  And me  I guess I was
one more piece in their puzzle  I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest  one more stranded survivor who was
found 

I was now one of them 

This story  it s our story  The survivors of the unfortunate accidents  the catastrophic malfunctions  the
fateful crashes  this is us  Floating alone  each of us facing the silence of the vacuum  we were found 

Once found  we can never be lost 

This is our Hotel California 

We can never leave 

“So  I m on a ship now? You do this a lot?”

A woman  introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful  shrugged  “Now and then ”

“What about my crewmates? Why didn t you save them?” As much as Jesse had irritated me  I didn t like the
picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave  body swollen and bloated  Who would tell his girl how he
had died?

“Couldn t ” said the captain  Jefferson  he called himself  clean shaven and smart  a picture of the perfect
entrepreneur  An opportunist and a businessman  that was Jefferson  “We re selective about our passengers ” he
continued  “You fit the bill  They didn t ”

Tiffany  she looked at the captain  grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder  She turned
to me  “Come on ” she said  before I could say anything else  “let s get you settled in ” No time for
questions  No time for answers 

 The ship had all the usual accoutrements  artificial gravity  tastefully painted walls  sound dampeners to
keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane  recycled air systems   and a few
less usual  lush carpeting  lighting that was decorative as well as functional  spacious corridors  The
occasional painting hung on the wall  generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met 
primarily   Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways  music  voices  the aroma of real food 

This was heaven  No seventy two virgins  but it would do 

“Where are we going?” I asked 

Tiffany looked back  “To your quarters  It s not far  you re not going to get blisters ”

“No  I meant  where s the ship going? What s our destination?”

Tiffany  she stopped walking  She gave me a look  pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to
share the news  “Honey ” she said  “You re going to be delighted  Destination everywhere  Destination
nowhere ”

This was hell  I died in those last moments  suffocating on my own exhaled breath  and this  this was my
reward 

Fact  The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty eight degrees Fahrenheit is three
hundred and forty three meters per second  or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per second 

It took me a couple days to realize I was  in fact  still alive  I mean  sure  I d had my moment of elation
when I had first realized I d been rescued  but it didn t sink in  After watching my ship tear apart  after
spending a good twenty three hours floating in silence in the wreck  wondering whether I was currently facing
stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth 
wondering what it felt like to suffocate  and after the feeling that yes  I was in fact going to die alone in
space had sunk in  it took time for that feeling to dissipate 

Fact  I wasn t dead 

After I realized this  I left my quarters  The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official
meals were taking place  but I hadn t bothered to acknowledge the invitations  It hadn t seemed relevant 
somehow  given that I was still reeling over the explosion  the deaths of my crewmates  and the rescue  I ve
heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock  I guess I was working my way through them  Food was
delivered to my quarters  Initially  I couldn t figure out why—I hadn t requested any be sent  Then I realized 
someone must have noticed I hadn t left  and was nice enough to send food my way  The accompanying bottle of
wine was a nice touch  I must have consumed it  too  because later on  the plates and the bottle were both
empty  I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed  staring up at the little etched swirls in the
ceiling  or slumped in the old fashioned armchair  staring out the windows at the stars  I did a lot of staring
and not moving 

Man  was it good to be done with that stage  

It was time to find out what hell looked like 

Fact  Hell is other people  Sure  the ship was spacious  We didn t pick up many passengers—just the select 
special few  scattered here and there between the stars  But we were all on this ship  and we were on it
together 

Cliques form in any decent sized group of people  Me  I was singled out by Sarah  an unassuming
forty something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the
other  She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro
cream dip onto a plate  The plate  by the way  was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish 
paprika dusted deviled eggs  toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese  and balls of
meat smothered in a tomato based sauce  Luxurious  even compared to the fare one would find in the high class
space stations and pleasure cruisers  Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship  it
was mouthwateringly  lip smackingly gorgeous  I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days
had been similarly amazing  I decided it couldn t have been 

“Liking the taste of the sweet life  eh? I m Sarah  and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup ” She
looked me over approvingly  “Come on  let s get you a glass of champagne ” I looked longingly at the slices of
cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar  but didn t protest 

The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot  It turned toward Sarah s wave and acknowledged her with a
nod  moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her  I marveled at the robot s
smoothness and coordination  Clearly  it was a high end model  Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and
pulled me away from the bar for more introductions  with Alexis trailing after us 

I spent the evening listening  mostly  Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food
provided  No one minded  Sarah s inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter 
Ray  a plump man who was grey where he wasn t bald  Zheng  short and dark and lean  with a very intense gaze 
He made me a little uncomfortable  Kishori  petite  her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached
nearly to her waist  I categorized them based on their appearances  hoping I d be able to pick them out of the
crowd again later  Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day to day activities  how so and so
had been seen in so and so s table at lunch and my wasn t that a surprise  and why hadn t the chef concocted
this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night  but of course those rolled meat
pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth  didn t they  and this was somehow an interesting fact 

After the first half hour  I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight  I
wasn t learning anything useful  I could have started asking questions  but I wanted to get my bearings first 
Tonight was for observation  I didn t bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more
interesting people  though  They all looked the same  clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less
apt  the hangers on  the circle with whom the gossip was shared  I wondered at the ship instead  All the fine
food and the ornamental lighting  it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain  If the barkeep was any
indication  I suspected similarly high class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship  How they were all
powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got  a quality robot like that was still an energy sink  It was
the brain  mostly  the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it
did ate up a lot of resources 

Sarah s crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled  all seemingly pleased to have
a new set of ears to talk at  I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised
to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen
movies—that I had seen during off time at Geminia Station 

By the end of the evening  when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room  a satisfying
haze had settled on my mind  It was nice  I decided  This ship  This life  The nagging questions about where
the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged  but somehow  seemed less urgent 
Did it truly matter what the ship s origin was and why Jefferson had saved me  if now  I was content?

Fact  It s easy to fall into patterns  I would wake late  checking the clock on my room s lightscreen to
make sure I hadn t slept through brunch  I would join the rest of the ship for meals  and I would take my turn
in the weight room  I would watch old films on the entertainment screens  taking mental notes for later
dinnertime discussions  I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks  I would attend afternoon dance
classes  so that when the evening dances came around  modeled after the historical social gatherings of several
hundred years prior   I would be less of an embarrassment to myself 

I did not ask questions  I told myself I should  I told myself that tonight  the observation period would
end and I d start puzzling out the ship s mystery  But I fell under the ship s sway  Bereft of my previous
familiar life  I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng  and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and
then  he was mostly her favorite dancing partner  she confided to us one night that his conversational skills
left something to be desired   I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long awaited vacation 
my clean break and my temporary retreat  I d try contacting those friends tomorrow  I continued to care little
for shipwide gossip  but our discussions of films and flicks  old and new  brought out my artistic 
story loving  argumentative side  a side of me I d tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an
engineer  It was a good life  if surreal  But I wasn t sure I wanted the dream stage to end 

Fact  Some places are timeless  Days passed  weeks passed  but I couldn t tell if it had been months or
years since I was rescued  All there was  all I remembered  was a blur  Gathering for drinks in the parlors 
playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets  some of it modern  some of it period dress
for special themed events   idling in the lounges  Now and then  a new face mingled in the crowd  Other faces
washed out  fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the
engines 

One of these evenings  we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post dinner drinks  lounging on couches
and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor   The  South  was in the title to
suggest that there were more ballrooms  There weren t   Sarah s circle had picked up another newcomer 
Adrienne  a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on
Earth  let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her  Maybe it was her curiosity  asking a
question I should have asked long before  that turned the conversation serious  maybe there was just something
special about that evening  Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life  hitting some threshold or some
breaking point  Regardless  when Adrienne asked what the ship s purpose was  we all gave it a measure of
thought  We dredged up half fledged theories and inchoate explanations  tossing these out the same way we
pitched ideas about the art films 

“I believe we ll see the end of the universe ” said Tiffany  Captain s cohort  she had a glass of
orange brown liquid in one hand  it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor  She swirled it
speculatively  I watched Adrienne  She tilted her head  listening  not speaking 

“Impossible ” said Zheng  sitting in the chair to her left  “We can t live that long ”

“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think ” said Jefferson  Yeah  the captain was there  with the
rest of us  He didn t drink  but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques 

“Maybe we ll travel at the speed of light and we won t age ” said Sarah  setting her wine glass on the
little round end table by her couch  “Maybe we re already traveling at the speed of light ” 

Tiffany  she nodded eagerly  “Relatively says it all ”

Zheng scoffed  “Also impossible  Even if we were traveling at ninety nine percent of the speed
of light—that s assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible  because it isn t—we d
still age  We d just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us ”

“And?” said Sarah  “Aging is relative  anyway  Besides  I wouldn t mind being around forever  Give our
ancestors purpose  Keep their dreams alive ”

“New hypothesis ” suggested Kishori  slipping into the conversation  “No one s immortal  In fact  the
opposite  We re all going to die ”

“Bleak ” commented Zheng  “But I like it ” He grinned at Sarah  who frowned  Ray took a drink from his glass
of ice water  and shook his head 

“We re all going to die  so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have?” Kishori gestured to the
bar  the carpets  the paintings  “All the luxuries money can buy ”

Tiffany took a drink  thinking  “All the luxuries money can buy ” she echoed 

Zheng looked skeptical  “Paid for how?”

“Smuggling ” responded Kishori  Matter of fact  Jefferson snorted  amused  “Think about it ” Kishori
continued  “where else would we get the money to buy all this?”

“Renegade smugglers  So what s our cargo  eh  captain?” Zheng joked  leaning back in his chair with his
glass of wine 

Jefferson shook his head and stood up  “I ll leave you to your speculation ” he said  A chorus of good
nights followed him out the door 

After the captain left  Zheng leaned in  He set his glass down on an end table  steepled his fingers
together  “We re revolting ” he told us  “And I don t mean that you disgust me  No  we re the start of a
rebellion  Did you hear what the captain said earlier? He means  we re going to change the future  The universe
as we know it won t be the same ”

“That s dumb ” said Sarah  “Wouldn t we know it if we were part of a rebellion?

Zheng shook his head  “The captain selected us for a reason  He has inside intelligence—how else would he
know where to find us? He knows about us ”

“That s still dumb ” said Sarah  “Inside intelligence? Don t you remember  there s not exactly one big
galactic government from which to steal information ”

“I still like my idea ” said Tiffany 

Me  I followed Adrienne s example and didn t speak up  fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in
gather info observation mode   though I thought Zheng had a point  Jefferson didn t share how he found people 
He didn t share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were  or why he saved some people but not others  But then
again  no one asked  I guess we all figured  he knew what he was doing  He had been at this savior business
longer than any of us  I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that 

“We re going to mean something ” Zheng was saying  “What we do  rebelling against the oppression of the many
governments that oppose us  we re going to leave a legacy ” He sounded certain  Enthusiastic  even 

Ray  he shook his head  and broke the quiet he d held most of the evening  “You ve got it all wrong ” He
looked from Sarah  to Adrienne  to Zheng  to Kishori and Tiffany  to me  “Obviously  we can t last longer than
the rest of the universe  We aren t giving anyone purpose  We re not even going to leave a legacy  All we re
doing is existing  All we re doing is eating and drinking and shitting  breathing and fucking and nothing
important  ever  We aren t special ”

“Again  bleak ” commented Zheng  Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet  She leaned forward  setting her
elbows on the foot stool in front of her 

“You never know when it will end ” Ray continued  not addressing any one of us in particular  “You can t
hold on forever  even if you don t ever  ever want to forget  How long until the memories slip away? How long
until all you remember is this  the ship  the thick red carpeting  the chandeliers  the empty conversations you
hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life  the reason you lived  the people and faces
and places  the emotions you felt  who and what you loved  when all that is gone  faded  what will you have
left?”

I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship  I wondered why  if he had such an unpropitious outlook  he
hadn t tried to change his situation  I wanted to ask  but he was still talking  and I was too self conscious
to interrupt 

“You can try to hold on ” said Ray  “You can try and try and try  Repeat stories to yourself in the
artificial night  sketch faces in your mind  You can make their names your mantra  But words  if you repeat
them enough times  lose their meaning  Emily emily em ill ee em i lee eh mill ee eh mih lee  My wife s name 
once  Repeat it enough times  it s just a sound  No longer grounded ”

Ray  he said  “If we last forever  if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out  it won t
mean a thing to us  We won t care that we re last and we won t care that there are no more stars  We aren t
angels  We re just dumb and lucky ”

“Pure dumb luck ” he said 

“Struck a nerve  huh?” said Zheng  

“Sorry ” said Ray  

“How long ago was that?” asked Adrienne  “Leaving your wife  I mean  Traveling on this ship ”

Ray  he looked down at his hands  folded together in his lap  fingers interlaced  “I don t know ” he said 
We were all quiet for a moment  Ray shrugged  then got up and left  We let him go  Silent  Self conscious  More
excuses were made  and after a few moments  only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom  She looked
across the circle of couches at me 

“What s your theory?” she asked me 

I shrugged 

“How long have you been here?”

“Not that long ” I said  “A couple weeks  I guess  Maybe a month or two ”

“Why don t you know for sure?” she asked 

I shrugged  I hadn t been counting days 

“What did you do before this? How were you found?”

“I was an engineer ” I explained how my ship had malfunctioned  no warning at all  The explosions  the
impossible rescue  “I don t know how Jefferson knew to find me there ”

She nodded  “The ship I was on  I guess that s what happened  too  Some vital part broke  and    well 
boom  It was all so fast ” She took a sip of her drink  plain water because  she had explained
earlier  she had never liked the taste of alcohol  then fixed her gaze on me  “I m going to figure it out ” she
said  “How and why this ship exists  I ll figure it out  then I m going to find a way home ”

I paced my room that night  unable to sleep  The more I thought about it  the less sense the ship made 
Worse  Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question  I had spent weeks asking nothing  contentedly
getting nowhere 

Fact  Adrienne intimidated me 

Fact  It s too easy to fall into patterns 

I resolved to break the pattern 

Another evening  another chandeliered room  another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d oevres 
Another circle of chairs and couches  another uncomfortable question 

“Has anyone ever left?” Adrienne looked at each of us in turn 

Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng 

Sarah frowned  “Now that you mention it  I haven t seen Alexis in days  I assumed he was indisposed ”
Kishori nodded in agreement 

I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow  “What?”

“Well ” Ray said  slowly  “People do leave  The approximate number of people at any given event
is always the same  But we see new faces ”

“You re sure it s not just some people being indisposed ? ” asked Adrienne  using Sarah s
phrasing 	

Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table  “Keep
adding people long enough  regardless  you get more overall  A couple people staying in their rooms  even if
you switch out the people  won t make a difference ” He dropped the pecans back into the dish  one by one 

“So where do they go?” Adrienne focused on Zheng  

I cut in  “Maybe a better question is  does anyone ever come back?”

Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance  Kishori chewed her lip  Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink 
After a moment  Ray said  “I don t think so ”

“Are there patterns?” Adrienne asked  “Who leaves?”

Again  there was an uncomfortable moment of silence  I hazarded a guess  “You don t notice  do you ”

Sarah looked indignant  “Of course we notice  But    well  no one important ever disappears  so it doesn t
really matter  does it ” I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left  and failing 
No one contradicted her  No one offered a different answer 

I looked at Adrienne  Mission accomplished  Our routine insouciance had been disrupted  The scales had
tipped  Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones  as it soon did  I dwelt on Adrienne s questions 
From the looks on my companions  faces  I knew they were thinking the same 

“How long have you been here?”

The question  previously posed to me  was presented to the rest of our group  excluding Ray  Adrienne had
been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill  recalling the last time the subject was
broached  

Sarah  she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass  “A long time  Got to be months
and months  at least ”

“You were here before I was ” said Kishori  “and so was Tiffany ”

I looked at Zheng  he shrugged  “Time passes in a weird way here  I kept track for a while—thirty eight
days—but after that    I guess I didn t see the point ”

Fact  Some places are timeless 

“Why not?” asked Adrienne 

“Days don t matter ” he said  “The eleventh of a month or the seventeenth  whether it s Wednesday or Sunday 
summer back on Earth or winter  it doesn t affect us here ”

Tiffany nodded  but Kishori spoke before the other woman could  “Why are you so interested?” she asked
Adrienne 

Adrienne met her gaze  “I don t want to be here forever ”

“But we re not here forever ” objected Sarah  “Remember? Alexis left ”

“Disappeared ” I corrected her  “We don t know how or why he left  Or where he went ”

Zheng looked thoughtful  He picked up his glass  swirled the liquid around  took a sip  then set the glass
back down  He glanced around at the rest of us  “Do you want to leave?” he asked  “Could you live anywhere else
now?”

I spoke up  “Yes ” I said  “I wouldn t miss this  much ” No one else said anything  I watched Adrienne s
eyes move from one face to the next 

Zheng  he addressed me again  leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense  steady gaze  “You
think that ” he said  “but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life  working and living and crying
in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”

I didn t answer 

Fact  It s too easy to fall into patterns 

Fact  I wasn t sure I wanted the dream stage to end 

My quarters felt stifling  Asphyxiating my mind  I sat sideways in the armchair  feet dangling over one arm 
neck resting against the other  absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I
ruminated on the situation  The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful  I inspected the arrays of
entertainment options—abstract  old style flatscreens  engrossing VR flicks and action games  a selection of
quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity  There was a schedule
advertising upcoming on ship events  such as dance classes  craft sessions  and discussion groups  and a list
of dinner invitations for me to respond to  A menu of display options  allowing me to customize all the
lightscreen s superficial characteristics  A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the
ship  That was all 

A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms  the ample closet space  and the attached bathroom facility
had similarly provided no fodder  Furniture  dark wood  expensive  polished  no secret compartments   clothes 
leftover tray of half consumed food from the previous day s lunch  toiletries  complete with miniature bottles
of sweet smelling apricot honey lotion   lightscreen  me 

I was discouraged and frustrated  I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship s mystery just
as much as she did  I wanted to find something  anything  that would prove all this was normal and sane  I
didn t want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences 	

I wanted my contentment back 

I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night  In one hand I balanced my plate of star shaped crackers  globs of
elegant dips and garnishes  little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale
green plant  and an array of other delectable  bite sized items  My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a
small table against a wall  She glared at me  but obediently let me pull her along 

“Tell me ” I said  after we sat  “what you have found ” It wasn t a question 

She gave me a grumpy look that informed me  quite clearly  of her current opinion of me  “Not if you re
going to be rude about it ”

I sighed  “Sorry ” I wasn t  not really  but I d lie to get the conversation going  “I want to know ” I
explained  in two brief sentences  my earlier impasse 

“I don t know much ” she said  still annoyed but at least cooperative  She reviewed the information gleaned
from our previous dinner conversations  adding  “I heard the captain say something yesterday  as I walking to
the Pyrope Parlor  I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side  talking to a couple
people  and they must not have known I was there  He said something about a wreck going well  And listen  when
they came round the corner  Ray was with the captain ”

The next time the captain stopped by our group  Tiffany tagging along  pretending that she  too  was a
social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone   we were ready 

“Is there a doctor on board?” asked Adrienne  “I ve been having headaches ” It was a lie  but we needed
information 

Jefferson nodded  “Down past the Emerald Lounge  second door on the left  All hours ” A robot  then  Medical
AI were even more expensive than the barkeep  I wondered how many people it treated  Had anyone on the ship
ever fallen seriously ill?

“Does he age?” asked Adrienne 

“The captain?” I shrugged  “I never thought about it ”

Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face  “That doesn t answer my question ” she said 

Adrienne only picked at her food  

“Not hungry?” asked Kishori sympathetically 

“No ” said Adrienne 

“At least have a drink ” said Sarah  “I find it takes the edge off ”

“She doesn t drink  remember?” said Kishori 

“Maybe that s the problem ” said Sarah 

“One hundred and forty seven is a magic number ” said Sarah  “You ever heard of Dunbar? Well  we ve got the
perfect size group right here ” Just enough for us all to recognize each other  Just enough for us all to be
able to barely avoid killing each other 

“Why doesn t anyone mutiny?” Adrienne asked  “If you dislike this place so much  why don t you do something
about it?”

“We can t ” said Ray  “What would we do?”

Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust  “You could force the captain to set down somewhere  Let
us off the ship  If he refuses  threaten him  If he still refuses  well  of all of us  isn t there
someone who can drive a ship?”

“That s murder ” objected Sarah 

“That s survival  ” Adrienne corrected her  “Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your
life?”

Sarah didn t reply 

I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge  looking out the windows at the stars 
Times like that  running on less sleep than I should  alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire
for the night  I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it  The stillness of
the room contributed  as did the view  Black and more black  speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to
break the emptiness  if only for a brief time  All of it was temporary  save for the black  That was tonight s
melodramatic theme  the ephemeral nature of life  Everything temporary  Everything to fade away  lost as dust
and scattered atoms between the stars  and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born 

Thinking about that  I wondered if Sarah s theory was right after all  Some things in this world  we have to
make them permanent ourselves  And Jefferson  he had done that  He had made us a constant  He made this
ship—this life—a constant  The one thing that was known  The one thing that wouldn t change 

Maybe everything we did  all the stories we told  maybe it was all lies  Maybe we d never know each other 
not truly  because we all hid behind the stories  creating the realities we wanted to see  But ultimately  this
ship  its purpose  our purpose—did it matter? We each had our own theory  Maybe that was enough  And all of us 
we were permanent characters in each others  stories  Maybe that made us more real  Maybe it made us feel less
alone 

“Mind if I join you?”

I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway  She smiled  then crossed the room to join me by the window  not
waiting for an answer  

“Some nights ” I said  “I can t see the meaning in any of it  All these things I do  they re just to pass
the time until I die ”

Adrienne looked at me  then back out through the window  “You don t see a meaning because there is no
meaning ” she said 

After all of it  as much as we feared being alone  we feared being vulnerable even more  Our instinct was to
hide 

“Look what I found ” Adrienne said  In her hands was a bottle 

And what happens to Adrienne?

I couldn t find her 

Jefferson was in the Captain s Lounge  

Fact  Sound is a vibration  The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty eight degrees
Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three meters per second  or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per
second 

“Up his dosage ” I heard the captain say  “I ve got a replacement lined up ”

I ran 

I didn t want to forget 

I didn t want to be harvested 

The last thing I remember  I was tearing down the corridors  Life boats  I thought  Every ship had life
boats  In case of emergency  break glass  I d find one  I d put on a space suit  I d get out of this ship  I d
find civilization again  A planet  A space station  Some other ship  Any place but this place 

Failing all else  I d suffocate  Alone 

Ray  he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls  finding no glass to break  “Relax ” he told me 
sliding a needle into my arm  “It ll pass ” he told me  He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing 

It passed 

This is my Hotel California 

I can never leave 



Tara stood stock still  waiting for the first tiny gleam from the scout craft to
appear in the darkness of the wormhole  The gentle constant breeze of recycled
air from the vent above blew an annoying hair against her nose  but she ignored
it 

A gasp from the psychic broke her silent vigil  and she turned 

 Results  Harmon?  she suppressed the surge of annoyance that ran through her as
she contemplated the psi s gift of getting all the hot news first 

Harmon s face slowly animated   joy sweeping in to replace stern concentration 
 Tarrin says the planet s a freaking gemstone! Thriving with life  large and
small forms  no buildings of any kind  hydrocarbons  metals  and a stable
atmosphere  He s not even bringing them back through for a face to face
briefing  He says we should come through now  immediately  before the probe is
reported late  

 Harmon  tell that good for nothing son of a beta to get his hindquarters
through the gate and back here NOW  or I ll open fire on him when we come back
through   Tara fumed  Of all the impertinence! Tarrin  no doubt with orders from
Mason  was questioning her command decisions  That s what I get for not using
mercenaries 

She returned to her watch  regarding her own reflection in the long window 
Mahogany black curly hair  cut short in the typical military style framed a
careworn  dark skinned face  It was not an attractive face right now  her ebony
eyes shadowed by hours on the watch  full lips pursed with frustration  She had
the look of every leader she had ever known  At six foot two  she stood a full
head taller than even her Arrallin first officer  Her glowering expression
completed the imposing effect  She picked imaginary flecks off her stark gray
jumpsuit  and snorted  You look like hell  Tar  Don t blow this  Don t let
fatigue get to you 

She used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew 
Harmon was an excellent addition to the bridge team  but was she open minded
enough to defy United Earth Command and sever all ties from Earth? She watched
the psi bob her head  unaware of the rest of the bridge  shaking blonde curls as
she chattered away with the approaching psi relay on Mason s ship  She seemed so
depthless   self conscious and shallow on the outside  but having that
incredible gift  There had to be more to her 

Well  if she didn t pan out  she d be terminated  Any crew member that would
jeopardize the project was meat  It would be a shame to lose that talent 
though 

Rakal  her first officer  was staring pensively at his panel  He was what this
was all about  She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap
out calculations on the panel  His pointed ears swiveled back and forth 
catching every sound from the bridge  while his long tail swished to the rhythm
of his thoughts  Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was
no common  beta furry   His silken fur  which would be tawny golden and striped
with jet black bands  was dyed perfectly to a pure black  and his mane trimmed
and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat  His eyes had
been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden
yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin  and leader of his hive 
Right now  he looked like an overgrown wolf who d learned touch typing 

The scout ship re emerged from the hole   a brilliant speck emerging from a
sphere of velvety blackness  It s hail crackled across the comm  and Tara spun
to retake her seat at the helm   Launch the second probe  Won t Central be
crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F
planet and a white dwarf system  Level 1 and 2 staffers should prepare to be
briefed and move out  This sounds like it s the one   The distinctive whuffle of
pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge  and Rakal let loose a small
growl  as if to caution his charges against false hope  They d scouted
twenty seven gates so far  and none had turned up anything worth the
Insurrection s time  Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that
would spell the end for the project  and the Arrallin species 


   
      
         
            A Wasted Day
            Richard Harding

            
               Part One
               When its turn came  the private secretary  somewhat apologetically  laid the
                  letter in front of the Wisest Man in Wall Street 
               “From Mrs  Austin  probation officer  Court of General Sessions   he explained 
                  “Wants a letter about Spear  He’s been convicted of theft  Comes up for sentence
                  Tuesday ”
               “Spear?” repeated Arnold Thorndike 
               “Young fellow  stenographer  used to do your letters last summer going in and out
                  on the train ”
               The great man nodded  “I remember  What about him?”
               The habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin 
               “Went on the loose  had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm 
                  he’s with Isaacs & Sons now  shoe people on Sixth Avenue  Met a woman  and
                  woke up without the money  The next morning he offered to make good  but Isaacs
                  called in a policeman  When they looked into it  they found the boy had been
                  drunk  They tried to withdraw the charge  but he’d been committed  Now  the
                  probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence  A letter from
                  you  sir  would—”
               It was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere  Young men who  drunk or
                  sober  spent the firm’s money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not
                  appeal to him  Another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent
                  in Europe  In Florence he had discovered the Correggio he had been sent to find 
                  It was undoubtedly genuine  and he asked to be instructed by cable  The price was
                  forty thousand dollars  With one eye closed  and the other keenly regarding the
                  inkstand  Mr  Thorndike decided to pay the price  and with the facility of long
                  practice dismissed the Correggio  and snapped his mind back to the present 
               “Spear had a letter from us when he left  didn’t he?” he asked   What he has
                  developed into  SINCE he left us—” he shrugged his shoulders  The secretary
                  withdrew the letter  and slipped another in its place 
               “Homer Firth  the landscape man ” he chanted  “wants permission to use blue flint
                  on the new road  with turf gutters  and to plant silver firs each side  Says it
                  will run to about five thousand dollars a mile ”
               “No!” protested the great man firmly  “blue flint makes a country place look like
                  a cemetery  Mine looks too much like a cemetery now  Landscape gardeners!” he
                  exclaimed impatiently  “Their only idea is to insult nature  The place was better
                  the day I bought it  when it was running wild  you could pick flowers all the way
                  to the gates ” Pleased that it should have recurred to him  the great man smiled 
                  “Why  Spear ” he exclaimed  “always took in a bunch of them for his mother  Don’t
                  you remember  we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds
                  picking flowers?” Mr  Thorndike nodded briskly  “I like his taking flowers to his
                  mother ”
               “He SAID it was to his mother ” suggested the secretary gloomily 
               “Well  he picked the flowers  anyway ” laughed Mr  Thorndike  “He didn’t pick our
                  pockets  And he had the run of the house in those days  As far as we know ” he
                  dictated  “he was satisfactory  Don’t say more than that ”
               The secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil  “And the landscape man?”
               “Tell him ” commanded Thorndike  “I want a wood road  suitable to a farm  and to
                  let the trees grow where God planted them ”
               As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was
                  occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad  the
                  Japanese loan  the new wing to his art gallery  and an attack that morning  in his
                  own newspaper  upon his pet trust  But his busy mind was not too occupied to
                  return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him  Or  by
                  some genius of memory  to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear
                  was to be sentenced for theft  It was a charming morning  The spring was at full
                  tide  and the air was sweet and clean  Mr  Thorndike considered whimsically that
                  to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding
                  a year to his sentence  He regretted he had not given the probation officer a
                  stronger letter  He remembered the young man now  and favorably  A shy  silent
                  youth  deft in work  and at other times conscious and embarrassed  But that  on
                  the part of a stenographer  in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street  was
                  not unnatural  On occasions  Mr  Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed 
                  impecunious royalty  on the lookout for a loan—at its ease 
               The hood of the car was down  and the taste of the air  warmed by the sun  was
                  grateful  It was at this time  a year before  that young Spear picked the spring
                  flowers to take to his mother  A year from now where would young Spear be?
               It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly  so quickly that his friends
                  declared he was a slave to impulse  It was these same impulses  leading so
                  invariably to success  that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man  He leaned
                  forward and touched the chauffeur’s shoulder  “Stop at the Court of General
                  Sessions ” he commanded  What he proposed to do would take but a few minutes  A
                  word  a personal word from him to the district attorney  or the judge  would be
                  enough  He recalled that a Sunday Special had once calculated that the working
                  time of Arnold Thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute  At that
                  rate  keeping Spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars 
               Out of the sunshine Mr  Thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda 
                  shut in on every side  hung by balconies  lit  many stories overhead  by a dirty
                  skylight  The place was damp  the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice 
                  and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans  A policeman  chewing stolidly 
                  nodded toward an elevator shaft  and other policemen nodded him further on to the
                  office of the district attorney  There Arnold Thorndike breathed more freely  He
                  was again among his own people  He could not help but appreciate the dramatic
                  qualities of the situation  that the richest man in Wall Street should appear in
                  person to plead for a humble and weaker brother  He knew he could not escape
                  recognition  his face was too well known  but  he trusted  for the sake of Spear 
                  the reporters would make no display of his visit  With a deprecatory laugh  he
                  explained why he had come  But the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did
                  not follow 
               The district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card   Henry Spear ”
                  he exclaimed  “that’s your man  Part Three  Judge Fallon  Andrews is in that
                  court ” He walked to the door of his private office  “Andrews!” he called 
               He introduced an alert  broad shouldered young man of years of much indiscretion
                  and with a charming and inconsequent manner 
               “Mr  Thorndike is interested in Henry Spear  coming up for sentence in Part Three
                  this morning  Wants to speak for him  Take him over with you ”
               The district attorney shook hands quickly  and retreated to his private office 
                  Mr  Andrews took out a cigarette and  as he crossed the floor  lit it 
               “Come with me ” he commanded  Somewhat puzzled  slightly annoyed  but enjoying
                  withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception  Mr 
                  Thorndike followed  He decided that  in his ignorance  he had wasted his own time
                  and that of the prosecuting attorney  He should at once have sent in his card to
                  the judge  As he understood it  Mr  Andrews was now conducting him to that
                  dignitary  and  in a moment  he would be free to return to his own affairs  which
                  were the affairs of two continents  But Mr  Andrews led him to an office  bare and
                  small  and offered him a chair  and handed him a morning newspaper  There were
                  people waiting in the room  strange people  only like those Mr  Thorndike had seen
                  on ferry boats  They leaned forward toward young Mr  Andrews  fawning  their eyes
                  wide with apprehension 
               Mr  Thorndike refused the newspaper  “I thought I was going to see the judge ” he
                  suggested 
               “Court doesn’t open for a few minutes yet ” said the assistant district attorney 
                  “Judge is always late  anyway ”
               Mr  Thorndike suppressed an exclamation  He wanted to protest  but his clear mind
                  showed him that there was nothing against which  with reason  he could protest  He
                  could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice
                  he was making  He had come among them to perform a kindly act  He recognized that
                  he must not stultify it by a show of irritation  He had precipitated himself into
                  a game of which he did not know the rules  That was all  Next time he would know
                  better  Next time he would send a clerk  But he was not without a sense of humor 
                  and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing  He laughed
                  good naturedly and reached for the desk telephone 
               “May I use this?” he asked  He spoke to the Wall Street office  He explained he
                  would be a few minutes late  He directed what should be done if the market opened
                  in a certain way  He gave rapid orders on many different matters  asked to have
                  read to him a cablegram he expected from Petersburg  and one from Vienna 
               “They answer each other ” was his final instruction  “It looks like peace ”
               Mr  Andrews with genial patience had remained silent  Now he turned upon his
                  visitors  A Levantine  burly  unshaven  and soiled  towered truculently above him 
                  Young Mr  Andrews with his swivel chair tilted back  his hands clasped behind his
                  head  his cigarette hanging from his lips  regarded the man dispassionately 
               “You gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me ” he commented cheerfully  To Mr 
                  Thorndike  the form of greeting was novel  So greatly did it differ from the
                  procedure of his own office  that he listened with interest 
               “Was it you ” demanded young Andrews  in a puzzled tone  “or your brother who
                  tried to knife me?” Mr  Thorndike  unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his
                  office unless escorted by bank messengers and plain clothes men  felt the room
                  growing rapidly smaller  the figure of the truculent Greek loomed to heroic
                  proportions  The hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin  and from there fell
                  to his pearl pin  which he hastily covered 
               “Get out!” said young Andrews  “and don’t show your face here—”
               The door slammed upon the flying Greek  Young Andrews swung his swivel chair so
                  that  over his shoulder  he could see Mr  Thorndike  “I don’t like his face ” he
                  explained 
               A kindly eyed  sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon Andrews with the
                  familiarity of an old acquaintance 
               “Is that woman going to get a divorce from my son ” she asked  “now that he’s in
                  trouble?”
               “Now that he’s in Sing Sing?” corrected Mr  Andrews  “I HOPE so! She deserves it 
                  That son of yours  Mrs  Bernard ” he declared emphatically  “is no good!”
               The brutality shocked Mr  Thorndike  For the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy 
                  but at once saw that it was superfluous  From the secure and lofty heights of
                  motherhood  Mrs  Bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon
                  a naughty child  She did not even deign a protest  She continued merely to smile 
                  The smile reminded Thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by
                  Murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his
                  native town 
               “That son of yours ” repeated young Andrews  “is a leech  He’s robbed you  robbed
                  his wife  Best thing I ever did for YOU was to send him up the river ”
               The mother smiled upon him beseechingly 
               “Could you give me a pass?” she said 
               Young Andrews flung up his hands and appealed to Thorndike 
               “Isn’t that just like a mother?” he protested  “That son of hers has broken her
                  heart  tramped on her  cheated her  hasn’t left her a cent  and she comes to me
                  for a pass  so she can kiss him through the bars! And I’ll bet she’s got a cake
                  for him in that basket!”
               The mother laughed happily  she knew now she would get the pass 
               “Mothers ” explained Mr  Andrews  from the depth of his wisdom   are all like
                  that  your mother  my mother  If you went to jail  your mother would be just like
                  that ”
               Mr  Thorndike bowed his head politely  He had never considered going to jail  or
                  whether  if he did  his mother would bring him cake in a basket  Apparently there
                  were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience 
               Young Andrews sprang to his feet  and  with the force of a hose flushing a gutter 
                  swept his soiled visitors into the hall 
               “Come on ” he called to the Wisest Man  “the court is open ”
               In the corridors were many people  and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the
                  assistant district attorney  Thorndike pushed his way through them  The people who
                  blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him  Their looks were anxious 
                  furtive  miserable  They stood in little groups  listening eagerly to a
                  sharp faced lawyer  or  in sullen despair  eying each other  At a door a tipstaff
                  laid his hand roughly on the arm of Mr  Thorndike 
               “That’s all right  Joe ” called young Mr  Andrews  “he’s with ME   They entered
                  the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak
                  chairs  Again  in his effort to follow  Mr  Thorndike was halted  but the first
                  tipstaff came to his rescue  “All right ” he signalled  “he’s with Mr 
                  Andrews ”
               Mr  Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs  “You sit there ” he commanded  “it’s
                  reserved for members of the bar  but it’s all right  You’re with ME ”
               Distinctly annoyed  slightly bewildered  the banker sank between the arms of a
                  chair  He felt he had lost his individuality  Andrews had become his sponsor 
                  Because of Andrews he was tolerated  Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted
                  to sit as an equal among police court lawyers  No longer was he Arnold Thorndike 
                  He was merely the man “with Mr  Andrews ”
               Then even Andrews abandoned him  “The judge’ll be here in a minute  now ” said the
                  assistant district attorney  and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the
                  judge’s bench  There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years
                  were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr  Andrews  Seated on
                  the rail  with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr 
                  Thorndike  they laughed and talked together  The subject of their discourse was
                  one Mike Donlin  as he appeared in vaudeville 
               To Mr  Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him  He
                  arose  and touched his sleeve  With infinite sarcasm Mr  Thorndike began  “My
                  engagements are not pressing  but—”
               A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail 
               “Sit down!” whispered Andrews  “The judge is coming ”
               Mr  Thorndike sat down 
               The court attendant droned loudly words Mr  Thorndike could not distinguish  There
                  was a rustle of silk  and from a door behind him the judge stalked past  He was a
                  young man  the type of the Tammany politician  On his shrewd  alert 
                  Irish American features was an expression of unnatural gloom  With a smile Mr 
                  Thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young
                  judge as was the robe to his shoulders  Mr  Thorndike was still smiling when young
                  Andrews leaned over the rail 
               “Stand up!” he hissed  Mr  Thorndike stood up 
               After the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words  every one sat
                  down  and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail 
               “I would like to speak to him now before he begins ” he whispered   I can’t
                  wait ”
               Mr  Andrews stared in amazement  The banker had not believed the young man could
                  look so serious 
               “Speak to him  NOW!” exclaimed the district attorney  ’You’ve got to wait till
                  your man comes up  If you speak to the judge  NOW—  The voice of Andrews faded
                  away in horror 
               Not knowing in what way he had offended  but convinced that it was only by the
                  grace of Andrews he had escaped a dungeon  Mr  Thorndike retreated to his
                  arm chair 
               The clock on the wall showed him that  already  he had given to young Spear one
                  hour and a quarter  The idea was preposterous  No one better than himself knew
                  what his time was really worth  In half an hour there was a board meeting  later 
                  he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad  at every moment questions were being
                  asked by telegraph  by cable  questions that involved the credit of individuals 
                  of firms  of even the country  And the one man who could answer them was risking
                  untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice  Inside the
                  railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech  He assured his honor
                  that he must have more time to prepare his case  It was one of immense importance 
                  The name of a most respectable business house was involved  and a sum of no less
                  than nine hundred dollars  Nine hundred dollars! The contrast struck Mr 
                  Thorndike’s sense of humor full in the centre  Unknowingly  he laughed  and found
                  himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his night clothes 
                  The tipstaffs beat upon the rail  the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an
                  indignant exclamation  Andrews came hurriedly toward him  and the young judge
                  slowly turned his head 
               “Those persons ” he said  “who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave
                  it ” As he spoke  with his eyes fixed on those of Mr  Thorndike  the latter saw
                  that the young judge had suddenly recognized him  But the fact of his identity did
                  not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered  In even  icy tones
                  the judge continued  “And it is well they should remember that the law is no
                  respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced  no
                  matter who the offender may happen to be ”
               Andrews slipped into the chair beside Mr  Thorndike  and grinned
                  sympathetically 
               “Sorry!” he whispered  “Should have warned you  We won’t be long now ” he added
                  encouragingly  “As soon as this fellow finishes his argument  the judge’ll take up
                  the sentences  Your man seems to have other friends  Isaacs & Sons are here 
                  and the type writer firm who taught him  but what YOU say will help most  It won’t
                  be more than a couple of hours now ”
               “A couple of hours!” Mr  Thorndike raged inwardly  A couple of hours in this place
                  where he had been publicly humiliated  He smiled  a thin  shark like smile  Those
                  who made it their business to study his expressions  on seeing it  would have
                  fled  Young Andrews  not being acquainted with the moods of the great man  added
                  cheerfully  “By one o’clock  anyway ”
               Mr  Thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves  For all he cared now young Spear
                  could go hang  Andrews nudged his elbow 
               “See that old lady in the front row?” he whispered  “That’s Mrs  Spear  What did I
                  tell you  mothers are all alike  She’s not taken her eyes off you since court
                  opened  She knows you’re her one best bet ”
               Impatiently Mr  Thorndike raised his head  He saw a little  white  haired woman
                  who stared at him  In her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men
                  who  at times of panic  fled to him  beseeching  entreating  forcing upon him what
                  was left of the wreck of their fortunes  if only he would save their honor 
               “And here come the prisoners ” Andrews whispered  “See Spear? Third man from the
                  last ” A long line  guarded in front and rear  shuffled into the court room  and 
                  as ordered  ranged themselves against the wall  Among them were old men and young
                  boys  well dressed  clever looking rascals  collarless tramps  fierce eyed aliens 
                  smooth shaven  thin lipped Broadwayards—and Spear 
               Spear  his head hanging  with lips white and cheeks ashen  and his eyes heavy with
                  shame 
               Mr  Thorndike had risen  and  in farewell  was holding out his hand to Andrews  He
                  turned  and across the court room the eyes of the financier and the stenographer
                  met  At the sight of the great man  Spear flushed crimson  and then his look of
                  despair slowly disappeared  and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and
                  gratitude  He turned his head suddenly to the wall 
               Mr  Thorndike stood irresolute  and then sank back into his chair 
               The first man in the line was already at the railing  and the questions put to him
                  by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney
                  and a court attendant  His muttered answers were in turn repeated to the
                  judge 
               “Says he’s married  naturalized citizen  Lutheran Church  die  cutter by
                  profession ”
               The probation officer  her hands filled with papers  bustled forward and
                  whispered 
               “Mrs  Austin says ” continued the district attorney  “she’s looked into this case 
                  and asks to have the man turned over to her  He has a wife and three children  has
                  supported them for five years ”
               “Is the wife in court?” the judge said 
               A thin  washed out  pretty woman stood up  and clasped her hands in front of
                  her 
               “Has this man been a good husband to you  madam?” asked the young judge 
               The woman broke into vehement assurances  No man could have been a better husband 
                  Would she take him back? Indeed she would take him back  She held out her hands as
                  though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory 
               The judge bowed toward the probation officer  and she beckoned the prisoner to
                  her 
            
            
               Part Two
               Other men followed  and in the fortune of each Mr  Thorndike found himself  to his
                  surprise  taking a personal interest  It was as good as a play  It reminded him of
                  the Sicilians he had seen in London in their little sordid tragedies  Only these
                  actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not
                  know  but which appealed to something that had been long untouched  long in
                  disuse  It was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because  as he
                  appreciated  it needed expression  an outlet  He found this  partially  in
                  praising  through Andrews  the young judge who had publicly rebuked him  Mr 
                  Thorndike found him astute  sane  his queries intelligent  his comments just  And
                  this probation officer  she  too  was capable  was she not? Smiling at his
                  interest in what to him was an old story  the younger man nodded 
               “I like her looks ” whispered the great man  “Like her clear eyes and clean skin 
                  She strikes me as able  full of energy  and yet womanly  These men when they come
                  under her charge ” he insisted  eagerly  “need money to start again  don’t they?”
                  He spoke anxiously  He believed he had found the clew to his restlessness  It was
                  a desire to help  to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being
                  lifted to their feet  Andrews looked at him curiously  “Anything you give her ” he
                  answered  “would be well invested ”
               “If you will tell me her name and address?” whispered the banker  He was much
                  given to charity  but it had been perfunctory  it was extended on the advice of
                  his secretary  In helping here  he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure  It was
                  much more satisfactory than giving an Old Master to his private chapel 
               In the rear of the court room there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn
                  and look  A man  who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs  was being
                  violently ejected  and  as he disappeared  he waved a paper toward Mr  Thorndike 
                  The banker recognized him as his chief clerk  Andrews rose anxiously  “That man
                  wanted to get to you  I’ll see what it is  Maybe it’s important ”
               Mr  Thorndike pulled him back 
               “Maybe it is ” he said dryly  “But I can’t see him now  I’m busy ”
               Slowly the long line of derelicts  of birds of prey  of sorry  weak failures 
                  passed before the seat of judgment  Mr  Thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to
                  the rail  and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope  He had
                  forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it  So great was his interest that
                  he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve  until Spear stood
                  almost at his elbow 
               Thorndike turned eagerly to the judge  and saw that he was listening to a rotund 
                  gray little man with beady  bird like eyes who  as he talked  bowed and
                  gesticulated  Behind him stood a younger man  a more modern edition of the other 
                  He also bowed and  behind gold eye glasses  smiled ingratiatingly 
               The judge nodded  and leaning forward  for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the
                  prisoner 
               “You are a very fortunate young man ” he said  He laid his hand upon a pile of
                  letters  “When you were your own worst enemy  your friends came to help you  These
                  letters speak for you  your employers  whom you robbed  have pleaded with me in
                  your favor  It is urged  in your behalf  that at the time you committed the crime
                  of which you are found guilty  you were intoxicated  In the eyes of the law  that
                  is no excuse  Some men can drink and keep their senses  It appears you can not 
                  When you drink you are a menace to yourself—and  as is shown by this crime  to the
                  community  Therefore  you must not drink  In view of the good character to which
                  your friends have testified  and on the condition that you do not touch liquor  I
                  will not sentence you to jail  but will place you in charge of the probation
                  officer ”
               The judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to Mr  Andrews  It was finished 
                  Spear was free  and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving
                  toward the door  Their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been
                  many  Mr  Thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment  Even though the
                  result relieved and pleased him  he wished  in bringing it about  he had had some
                  part 
               He begrudged to Isaacs & Sons the credit of having given Spear his liberty 
                  His morning had been wasted  He had neglected his own interests  and in no way
                  assisted those of Spear  He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews
                  called him by name 
               “His honor ” he said impressively  “wishes to speak to you ”
               The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr  Thorndike by the hand  Then he made a
                  speech  The speech was about public spirited citizens who  to the neglect of their
                  own interests  came to assist the ends of justice  and fellow creatures in
                  misfortune  He purposely spoke in a loud voice  and every one stopped to
                  listen 
               “The law  Mr  Thorndike  is not vindictive ” he said  “It wishes only to be just 
                  Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences  But when there
                  is good in a man  I  personally  want to know it  and when gentlemen like
                  yourself  of your standing in this city  come here to speak a good word for a man 
                  we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen  I thank you for
                  coming  and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and
                  public spirited ”
               It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing  but inwardly Mr  Thorndike glowed
                  with pleasure  It was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him
                  he had done well  From the friends of Spear there was a ripple of applause  which
                  no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress  and to the accompaniment of this 
                  Mr  Thorndike walked to the corridor  He was pleased with himself and with his
                  fellow men  He shook hands with Isaacs & Sons  and congratulated them upon
                  their public spirit  and the type writer firm upon their public spirit  And then
                  he saw Spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully 
               Spear did not offer his hand  but Mr  Thorndike took it  and shook it  and said 
                  “I want to meet your mother ”
               And when Mrs  Spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she
                  was  and how grateful  he instead told her what a fine son she had  and that he
                  remembered when Spear used to carry flowers to town for her  And she remembered
                  it  too  and thanked him for the flowers  And he told Spear  when Isaacs &
                  Sons went bankrupt  which at the rate they were giving away their money to the
                  Hebrew Hospital would be very soon  Spear must come back to him  And Isaacs &
                  Sons were delighted at the great man’s pleasantry  and afterward repeated it many
                  times  calling upon each other to bear witness  and Spear felt as though some one
                  had given him a new backbone  and Andrews  who was guiding Thorndike out of the
                  building  was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when
                  Thorndike became a banker 
               The chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with
                  written calls for help from the office  They pounced upon the banker and almost
                  lifted him into the car 
               “There’s still time!” panted the chief clerk 
               “There is not!” answered Mr  Thorndike  His tone was rebellious  defiant  It
                  carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune  “I’ve wasted most of this
                  day ” he declared  “and I intend to waste the rest of it  Andrews ” he called 
                  “jump in  and I’ll give you a lunch at Sherry’s ”
               The vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building 
               “Wait till I get my hat!” he called 
               As the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them  the sense
                  of duties neglected added zest to their holiday  and young Mr  Andrews laughed
                  aloud 
               Mr  Thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly  “I was wondering   said Andrews 
                  “how much it cost you to keep Spear out of jail?”
               “I don’t care ” said the great man guiltily  “it was worth it ”
            
         
      
   


   
      
         
            Foster A  Ranney
            Nathan’s Bylichka
            
            Dedicated to Neil Gaiman  Radiohead and Black Sabbath
            
            Strange things have always happened to my family  It came in through my mother s blood  my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories  bylichkas  of ancestors with the  second sight   stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks  and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times  When I asked her if she d ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing  I mean – she would always look sad and tell me   No  not since the family came to America has anything happened to us  But if you ever should see a faerie  tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly   As I got older  I shook the tales off with a nod and a  Yes  Nana  
            I got older and went to school  then to college  and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs  webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything  My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school  Sometimes we d get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges  and we d rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up  Boston is a strange place at night  You wouldn t believe half of the shit I ve seen  even when I was straight 
            It was a Friday night  Rachel and I went out to dinner  and when we finished  she saw that there was a message on her cell phone  She checked it there in the restaurant  Her head tilted into the phone as she listened  her pleather purse on her lap  shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T shirt  “It’s from Mitch ” she said  folding up the phone  “He says we should meet him tonight  there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month ”
            “I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight  I’m not sure I’m up for a night out ” I was feeling calm and private that night  It seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal  cupped hands offering a place for two  not the burning  open darkness of a rave 
            “Baby  let’s go  It’s been over a week  and I want to dance  Let’s go together  you know you’ll have fun once you get into it ” She bit the inside of her bottom lip  looking at me like I was breaking her poor  sweet heart  I’m a sucker for that  and she knows it 
            “Okay  Rachel  Let’s go  you’re probably right ”
            She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table  her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing  not just pressing your face into someone else’s  
            “Let’s not get fucked up tonight  though  okay  Rache? We don’t – ”
            “Sure  babe  Come on  I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself  Let’s not waste any more time ” She stood up and I followed her out to the street  It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light  Without hearing the car horns  I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes  If it was March  that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half  It was last February  after the winter break  that we moved in together  Now spring was back  under the concrete  and I could smell it even here 
            “Isn’t it an amazing night  Rache? Even the city feels alive when spring comes ”
            “Taxi!” She waved down a car and pulled me in  In a few minutes  we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church  After she paid the driver  she grabbed my arm  laughing  and we ran down the street  I heard the pulse already  We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too  the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest  Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing  We kissed and slipped inside 
            The old vaulted church was stripped down  there was no cloth on the altar  just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer  Through the dark  I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix  A confessional too beaten up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside  and where the pews had been taken out  a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon 
            Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue lit  shadowed vault and the light catching haze from who knows what rising between the DJ and the crowd  There was a terrific echo  each beat reverberating inside of the next  and the old stained glass windows rattled in their frames  On the dance floor  people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air 
            I danced with Rachel for a while  but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes  She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd  
            When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song  I glanced over at the bar  It was just a little set up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share  mostly beer  Rachel was standing with a plastic cup  looking like she was having a conversation  but I couldn’t see anyone else there  The next time the crowd split  I saw him  He stood in front of a blue light  so I couldn’t see him clearly  but what I saw was memorable  He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet  and his hair gleamed black against his white skin  The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor  setting off his striking face without illuminating its details  and his wrists flashed white in the darkness  He didn’t move  just stared and held his drink  
            The next time I saw them  his mouth was moving  She nodded and he took her arm  I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall  and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong 
            Saturday morning  I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home  I called Mitch and our other friends  hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses  but I had no luck  A couple of them remembered seeing her leave  but none of them had seen the thin man with her  I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features  even in that distorting light 
            I caught a taxi back to the church  It was still a mess  but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared  I walked across what had been the dance floor  The church was completely different now  sunlight fell through the stained glass  catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry  healthy warmth into the edges of the room  through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights  I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which  if she were in a situation where I should be doing something  would probably be never 
            Standing in the center of the church  I took out my cell phone and called the police  “I need to file a missing persons report  …Rachel Frieze  Last night  walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock  What? …But  sir  this is an unusual situation  She didn’t come home last night  none of her friends have seen her  …Sir  if she’s in any danger  it will probably be too late to help her by that time  My girlfriend has disappeared  I don’t even know where to start looking  and I need help! …Yes  sir  I understand ” The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight  I closed the phone  
            Walking out of the church  a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise  A cold front must have hit while I was inside  Glancing down the street  I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time  and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran  I pulled my T shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go  but I wasn’t ready for cold  
            Walking didn’t build up much heat  it just moved the air enough to chill me more  After I’d walked about a block  a car rolled up behind me  It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry  This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods  I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it  
            I heard an automatic window roll down  “Hey ” said a male voice  “do you need some help?”
            I turned around  The man looked over forty  and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street  “It’s a long way to anywhere worth going ” he said  “Would you like some help?”
            “Ah  I think I’m fine  thanks ” I told him  and turned back to the sidewalk 
            “Really  I’d like to help  Please  hop in  You don’t look dressed for this weather ”
            I glanced back over my shoulder  “No thanks  sir! I’m just fine  Really  don’t worry about me ”
            “Nathan Spencer  I offer you help  I advise that you not refuse me a third time ”
            I stopped and looked back at him  surprised  He met my eyes coolly  “How do you know my name?”
            “I know your family  Get in  We have a lot of work ahead of us  and it’s best to start now ”
            I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat  Before I had my belt on  we were rolling forward  “Okay ” I said  “I’m in the car  Now  will you tell me how you know my family  and how you happened to be driving by just now? In fact  why didn’t you call me by name the first time? And how did you recognize me when – ”
            “That’s enough! I can only answer one question at a time  I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours  I am here now because you called for help  and no one else would answer ” He turned onto the next street and shifted up  “I will help you find your Rachel  I have to warn you  though  you won’t like what I have to tell you ”
            I shivered  Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved  “Tell me anyway  If she’s in trouble  I want to find her  wherever she is ”
            My driver took a deep breath  As he did  his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines  like wrinkles  running across the sides of his neck  “Nathan ” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation  “Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet  This person  like me  is not a member of traditional society  You see  Nathan  there is …separate from your society …oh  damn it  I’ve never had to give this conversation before  Come on  I have something to show you ” With that  he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before  We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned  My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year  
            In front of a few houses  there were cars parked  but there were almost none on the streets  Their bumpers looked ready to drop off  and their paint was half smog  I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here  “Hey ” I said  “are you sure that we should be going this way? I mean – ” 
            “Just ignore that ” he told me  “You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment ” That just unnerved me more  As we kept driving  the anxiety grew more pronounced  I noticed that there were some people on the street  people the same color as the soiled buildings  Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes  “Okay  this is the spot ” said my driver  pulling over  He parked and got out  
            “Is it really safe to leave the car …” he was already walking toward the squat  brick windowed building we were parked next to  Glancing back at that gleaming glare  I decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car  I hopped out  ran after him  and reached him just as he was knocking on the door  Someone opened it a crack  then ushered us in 
            Inside  the building opened up  The ceiling was high and wooden  and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall  It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub  Then I looked down and saw what had let us in  “Nepthys  my man! What up?” The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap  “Nice  my man ” he said as they clasped hands  “Who’s the freak?”
            “This is someone from Ivan’s family  Did I ever tell you about them?”
            “Yeah  one time  man  but you were pretty fucked up  What’s your problem  kid?”
            The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach  His skin was brown and stretched  like some diseased sapling’s bark  It pulled back around his fingertips  which bore things that might have been nails or claws  When he grinned  I saw that his teeth were sharp and small  like a hunting cat’s  Under matted hair  his eyes had slit pupils 
            Nepthys quickly answered for me  “Girlfriend troubles  She came down here with someone after a party  and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies ”
            “Bummer  So  what’s the cat look like?”
            He turned to me  Nepthys nodded  “It’s okay  you can trust him  That’s why we came here ”
            It was easier to talk than to question  “I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel  He was standing right in front of some blue lights  so I couldn’t see him very well  but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin  It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly  He was slim  almost drawn  but he had a kind of … luster to him  I guess  He wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives  you know?”
            They nodded  “Oh  totally ” said the hunchback  “I get that all the time around here ”
            “He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet  I couldn’t tell in the dark  but it had ruffles at the throat  things like that  He really stood out  That’s why I couldn’t understand why no one else remembered him  He had some rings  too  I remember that he hardly ever moved  just stared at Rachel  Even when he talked  he hardly opened his mouth  I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music ”
            The two glanced at each other  “What do you think?” asked the hunchback 
            “I’ve looked into it a little  and I do think we might be dealing with one of them  Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”
            “Not that I can remember  man  I can send you to a guy who knows all about them  though  If this cat’s for real  I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know ”
            “You’re a wonder  Dvorov  We should head straight over  It won’t be long before nightfall ”
            “Oh yeah  man  Here  let me write down how to find him ” The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail  then handed it to Nepthys  “Here you go  man  Good luck!”
            “Thanks  Dvorov  I owe you one  Let’s go ” That last one was to me  I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left  He gave me a half hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing  and whether I should be wearing body armor  
            Back on the street  I began to see things that I had never looked for until then  Still in my initial shock  I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked  I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them  and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail  The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog  it had a leeching  heavy dimness  I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light  A corpulent  batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle  Leaning from the rough hewn window of one building on our right was something with long  green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill  Thirty five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed  I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards 
            “We  and thousands like us  have been living separately as long as there has been a human society ” said my driver  I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills  “We interact with humans  take advantage of them  grant them boons  sometimes even become their friends  but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction  At this point  we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional 
            “The only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours  Love ins  raves  gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion  that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over  and that is where Rachel met someone from this world  Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this  where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner  with the right protective spells ”
            He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us  “Okay  Nathan  We should get started right away  There’s no time to waste ” 
            He saw that I wasn’t moving  Setting an arm on my shoulder  he said  “Nathan  what you see here might be frightening  but those things you saw are people just like you  They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms ”
            “Thanks  It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity ”
            “Nathan  you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel  Well  she’s here and she needs your help  Now  the more we can do before nightfall  the better ”
            “But why are you even helping me? Until thirty seconds ago  I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness ” 
            “Nathan  I told you  my family owes yours a debt  In this world  one’s word is a promise  Now  can we get going?”
            I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye  “Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name ”
            “You’ve got a deal  Let’s go ”
            As we headed down the sidewalk  I said  “What is your name  anyway?”
            “That’s a question you learn not to ask here  What you may call me is Nepthys ”
            Holding Dvorov’s directions  Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway  I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were  Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other  he did not inspire confidence 
            “Just at this corner ” he said  interrupting my immanent panic attack  “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er  counterclockwise  then face east  East is that way ” He pointed at the wall to our right  “Don’t let the sun fool you  Then I’m going to shed a little blood  but don’t worry  none of yours ” I blinked at him  but he just kept walking until we reached the corner  “Okay  you might feel silly  but just turn three times to your left  Try to keep in time with me ” We spun around three times  and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust  The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground  and I jumped back  When it had all burnt  a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner  Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it  opening the door  “Are you coming?”
            We slipped through the door and came out  not inside the building  but on a busy street in a completely different part of town  The sky  cupping over squat buildings  was less yellow here  and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East  Nepthys took us immediately to the right  where he led us to a cart filled with herbs  Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon  rosemary  and scents I couldn’t place  The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland  it had the same opium dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar  Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart  and with its long  many shouldered pole of a torso  it rose over our heads even while seated  Its face was small and wrinkled  with penny sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose  “Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs?” it asked  “There are no finer to spice a meal  nor purer to mix a potion  Please  let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs ”
            “We’re not here to browse ” Nepthys told him  “We’d like to see a man about some garlic ”
            The thing frowned  “We have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart  gentle sir  If – ”
            “You know what I mean  Please  if we could see him  we would be much obliged  I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons ”
            It hissed thoughtfully  “True  true  Step behind the cart and enter through the door there  using your left hand to open the door and your right – ” he looked at me “ – to close it ”
            “Thank you ” Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart 
            The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack! The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs  At the top was one door  We entered 
            The room held a bed  a bookcase  and a desk with one chair  Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls  On the bed was a small  ratty man  I smelled matted hair and cedar chips  He opened one eye when we came in but did not move 
            “We’re here for information about a vampire ” said Nepthys 
            “Oh  shit!” I said 
            “Sorry  kid  –Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”
            “Wait  Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires  Frankly  I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire  There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are  Are …look  are they as bad as people in my world think they are?”
            “I don’t know  They’re almost as rare here  and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire ”
            “Only unsuccessfully  right?”
            “No  those people don’t usually leave stories ”
            “Oh  thanks  Nepthys  for your confidence inspiring tales of experience  So they’re probably worse than we think  okay  that’s great  Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”
            “My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against  Okay? Don’t forget  she’s your girlfriend  Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman  I can hear your heartbeat from over here ”
            I shut up and tried to breathe  Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed  who had not moved  “Please  accept our apologies  As you can see  our situation is of personal importance to the young man  Now  may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire? It would be a great help to us ”
            The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air  Finally  in a pinched rasp  he said  “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector  I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm ”
            “Sir  we simply want to discover whether this individual is  in fact  a vampire  If there is any boon that you would have us do in return  we would be glad to do it ”
            He continued to lie in place  still breathing heavily  I tried to keep myself calm  Then  with a sigh  he said  “I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed  It would allow me to leave this bed  despite my current illness  My problem is that it was not made in this realm  but by a human  and only a human may handle it  The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it  If you would fetch me this stone  I would tell you what I can ”
            “Of course we will fetch you the stone ” Nepthys assured him  “You have our thanks ”
            Outside  the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone  He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street  and we set off 
            When we reached the street  I expected some sort of temple  or a row of antiquaries  or at least a sleazy  black market relics merchant  Instead  it looked like we were in the red light district  women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys  Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them  He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted  like a saint under G d’s light  and handcuffed  
            Inside  the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions  Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive  A large woman  similarly decorated  quickly drifted up to us 
            “Good evening  gentlemen ” she said  “May I invite you to have a cup of tea?”
            “No  thank you ” said Nepthys  “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer  Are you the proprietor of this shop?”
            “Yes ” answered the woman  “I am Madame Entera  at your service  How can I help you gentlemen?”
            “We are here to see about a certain stone ”
            She raised an eyebrow  “Are you? Well  we don’t get many customers asking about that item  Please  walk this way ”
            She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen  The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome  with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd  floppy hats on the other  After this  we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside 
            “Excuse me ” I said  ignoring Nepthys’ warning look  “but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”
            The woman laughed  “Why  the merchandise  of course ” she said  
            Nepthys leaned close to my ear  “This is a slave shop ” he explained quietly 
            The woman paused before another door  this one not barred but locked  As she brought out the key  she said  “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades  but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items  We’ve had genies  indentured sorcerers  even golems and the occasional elf  This is one of the stranger items  though  It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it  If we only had a human on our staff  we could have done so ages ago and sold it off  but we have no such luck ” She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room  “Here it is ” she said 
            With a flourish  she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire  intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls  In its center  under a spearing  white light  was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth  on which lay a gray  plum sized rock 
            “A marvel  isn’t it?” she said  “That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder ”
            “That it is ” Nepthys assured her  “What would convince you to part with it?”
            She considered this  looking him over  “You wouldn’t give me the human  would you? No ” she said  seeing his expression  “that would make the stone rather useless ” Nevertheless  she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”  I have never felt so appraised in all my life  “He looks healthy ” she said  “how about a pint of his blood?”
            “A pint? Madame  I have his health to consider ”
            “Half a pint  then – and his hair ”
            Nepthys turned to me  “Well  kid  what do you think? Remember  this is your quest  I’m not giving my blood ”
            “As if I wanted it ” interrupted the woman  
            “I think it’s a fair deal  considering the return ” he told me  “but it’s up to you ”
            I thought about it  then nodded 
            “Marvelous!” cried the woman  “One half pint of human blood  willingly given  and his fine head of hair for the stone ” 
            She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping  There was a wooden chair  where she sat me down and asked me to wait  Soon  she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl  which she put on the table beside me  “Roll up your sleeves ” she told me  She opened the bowl and carefully  gingerly brought out a fat  dripping leech  It must have been larger than my finger  She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm  The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow  where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin  I thought that I could feel a slight itching 
            “They take about a quarter pint each ” said Madame Entera  drawing out another skinny leech  “They’re quick  too  We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished ” Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber 
            Half an hour later  I left the room pale and bald  running my fingers over my scalp  At least the barber hadn’t nicked me  Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room  where Nepthys was waiting by the door  “Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it ” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him  “Thank you for doing business at our house  and I hope to see you again!”
            I left not a little unnerved  and still woozy from the leeches  “Come on ” said Nepthys  “you could use a drink ”
            We hit a bar on the next street over  “Vodka  straight up ” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter  “and a Bloody Mary for my friend  Make it extra bloody ” When our drinks came  he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary  “That should help ” he said  “You could run on empty with a little of that stuff  It won’t refill your blood supply  but while that’s in your system  you won’t even need blood ” He grinned at me  “Drink up  kid ”
            I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery  Nepthys slapped me on the back  “Okay ” I said  “now that we’re sitting down  can you explain a little more of what’s going on here? I mean  what is this place  really?”
            He thought about that  “I think that our world is a reflection of yours  or yours is a more boring reflection of ours  This place is just a little of both  In America  things are still weird after the European conquest  The natives are still here  but so is everyone else  The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities  We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms ”
            “What do you mean?”
            “Okay  take elves ” He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot  “You figure they’re some Lincoln green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory  right? Not in America  Here  they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world  too  right? Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs  Some of them actually commit to this society  though  There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf  He has a real ear for it  When they do decide to do something for real  they’re always the best at it ” He downed the second shot  “I am glad to be out of the favor trading scene for half a minute  It’s exhausting to talk to those people  One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something  So what else do you want to know  Nathan?”
            “I don’t know …hey  what about the nature spirits  things like that? I mean  where do the dryads fit in a place like this?”
            “If the tree isn’t around  the dryad isn’t around  It’s as simple as that ”
            That made me a little sad  They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school  “Well  what about you? How did you get to America?”
            “My parents came over from Russia  just like your family  My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate  but we don’t toss those around in this place  They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary  When the Russian government dammed the river  my parents decided that instead of dying with the river  they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected  I was born here  and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river  Sure  I miss having a place to settle down  but it’s better than waiting to get dammed ” He took another shot of vodka 
            “Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka? I mean  we might have a lot of work ahead of us ”
            “Are you kidding? I can drink like a fish  kid  We should get going  though  Still woozy?” I nodded  “A little walking should get the stuff into your system  Come on  let’s go ”
            As we left the bar  I asked to see the rock  “Why?” Nepthys asked 
            “I’m just curious  I want to see what a magic stone looks like  Don’t worry  I’ll be careful not to touch it ”
            He thought about it  then handed me the pouch  I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside  It looked like a normal river stone  a gray oval with a white stripe through it  As long as I looked at it  it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow  
            Suddenly  what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me  I almost tripped over him  and the stone went flying out of the pouch  Nepthys tried to grab it  but  by reflex  I caught it first  
            Immediately  I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid  “Nathan ” said Nepthys  “I think that you just did something very stupid ”
            “I agree ” I told him  The stone was as warm as human flesh now  and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat  I don’t know  Then there was light  a kind of rosy glow  and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air  The air around me seemed to still sound  and light came in around the corners of my eyes  “Do you know what this thing does?” I shouted  hardly able to hear myself 
            Nepthys was saying something that looked like  “I have no idea!” but I couldn’t hear him  The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in  converging on the rosy glow around the stone  and for a moment I was blind  Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street  There was no sign of the stone 
            “I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop ” said Nepthys  The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow  and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot  Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles  and soft  white leather boots held her feet 
            When she didn’t move  I knelt down and put a hand to her brow  As soon as I touched her  her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist  I couldn’t move 
            “Name me ” she said 
            I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation  but Nepthys stopped me  “Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’  okay? The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back ”
            I was at a loss  I’d never named anyone before  I thought back to one time when I’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that I’d always liked the name – 
            “Amy ”
            Nepthys looked at me incredulously  “You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone  having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer  and you name her ‘Amy’?” Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm  but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss 
            I stood up and Amy stood with me  “So …back to our garlicky friend?”
            “I suppose so ” said Nepthys  “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up ”
            We walked back to the herb stand  The vendor stared a little at Amy  his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp  but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs 
            When Nepthys opened the little man’s door  he rolled over and grinned to see us  but when Amy walked in  he blanched  “What!” he screamed  “You idiots! You woke it up? Get out of my sight this instant!”
            “But …but sir ” I said  “are you sure she’s no help to you?”
            “Not if you named it already  you ninny  and I’m sure that you have! Fools! Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back? …I thought as much  Now leave  before I call the rats on you ”
            We left  Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck  “You idiot ” he hissed  “do you know how much you’ve set us back? I should say  set yourself back  since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for ” I thought about Rachel  in the excitement  I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts  “You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact  Come on  we’re heading out ” He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs  Walking outside  I was shocked to see that it was already dark  “Night comes quickly here ” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me  “Didn’t I warn you?”
            “Okay ” he said as we hit the street  “we’re going to see another friend of mine  First  though  we are getting you a hat  You look ridiculous with a shaved head ” At a nearby stand  he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston  It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front  Amy liked it  I think  She still hadn’t spoken since I named her  so I wasn’t sure 
            He took us to a squat  long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal  The black door opened as we came up to it  and a pale man opened the door  He was naked  but there was nothing to hide  his body was hairless and completely smooth  I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity  His eyes were white  From behind him  I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest” 
            “I’m here to see Isis  Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her ”
            The man closed his eyes  A moment later  he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in  Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up  taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind  I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes  wondering what they were staring at  Amy gave my hand a squeeze 
            Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade  a vaulted  ribbed intestine of a hallway  whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic  I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting  like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall  but when I turned  it was still 
            Then there was a door  which opened as we approached  Inside  the space opened into a wide  square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size  In the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman  surrounded by more pale men  These were incontestably male 
            “Nepthys!” said the woman  slithering up across the furs to sit up  As she rose  her robes fell open and I realized that  except for what looked like a red silk kimono  she was naked – naked and stunning  I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes  “It’s been years since I’ve seen you  Please  come and sit beside me  and introduce your friends ”
            “This man is here in search of his lover  who was stolen from him in the human world ” said Nepthys  ushering us toward the woman in silk  “The girl is …surprising ” he concluded 
            “And I am Isis ” said the woman  offering her hand to me  I took it and  dropping to one knee  gave her fingers a small kiss  It seemed appropriate  “It is an honor to meet you  Lady Isis ” I said 
            She laughed  liquid  alluring  alarming  “Oh  precious! He has lovely manners  Nepthys  despite his poor taste in hats  You may leave out the ‘Lady ’ boy  I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am ” A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes  “Now  how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge? I hope I can start by offering some wine ”
            Nepthys poured out wine for three of us  “May I have a little more of what you gave me before  Nepthys?” I asked  “I still feel a little woozy ” He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me  The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar  but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth 
            Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly  “You’ve lost blood  boy? This story might be interesting  Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?”
            “It was part of the price for this girl  who was a rock at the time ” explained Nepthys  
            “I have a feeling that she was worth the trade ” I added  Amy  still holding my hand  smiled 
            “She may be at that ” said Isis  gazing at her  “That sweet  small nose  and her soft lips – she’d kiss well  I should think  if gently  She has good blood under her cheeks  Good  round breasts  too  even though they’re small  they suit her ” Amy didn’t blush  and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying 
            “She would have been worth it ” Nepthys interrupted  “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact  He was going to give us valuable information for her ”
            “Now I understand why you’re here ” said Isis  “So what do you need to know?”
            “You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way ” said Nepthys apologetically 
            “Mmm ” she replied  I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant 
            “I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire  Isis …you know some way to locate the undead  don’t you?”
            “I do  Describe this one to me  If I know him  I can find him  If not  you’ll have to bring me something to work with ”
            Nepthys looked at me  I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin  his dark hair  the way that light seemed to flow around him  as best as I could  Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full  hanging breasts  When I had told her all that I could remember  she blinked her black lashes and said  “I remember him ”
            “You do?” Nepthys could hardly believe her  “That’s amazing!”
            “It is  I would have sworn to you that he was dead  He should be  I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot ” She sat up  running her hands along her pale  round thighs  “All right  then  Let me see if I can find him ”
            Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands  A dark glow coalesced around her palms  Amy leaned forward  looking amazed  The glow reflected on her pink face  casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat strong cheeks  Tiny drops of blood began to seep out of Isis’ palms as her brow creased  Her candy lips twisted into a frown  The dark glow grew stronger and larger  filling the air for about a foot around her hands  In her palms  the droplets of blood swelled into small pools  
            The dark glow began to flicker  and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry  The pools in her hands grew deeper  She didn’t shed a bead of sweat  and I didn’t even see her draw a breath  but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame  Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake  The blood in her palms  still filling up  began to ripple  Shivers swept through her body  and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him  He glanced at me with honest concern  probably the first honest moment he’d shown me  ‘Is she all right?’ I didn’t know 
            Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out  splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs  She gasped and the dark glow went out  taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam  Isis collapsed on the fur  strings cut  
            Now Nepthys lunged forward  took her by the arms  “Isis  what happened? Are you hurt?”
            She shook her head  rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something  “What did you say?” asked Nepthys 
            She rolled onto her back  her arms crossed tightly over her chest  For the first time  she looked vulnerable  When she finally spoke  I had to lean close to hear her  “I found your vampire ” she said  “but he might know that someone’s looking for him  He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden  You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can ” She turned to me with tired sympathy  “I didn’t see a girl with him  Hurry  though  and you might find him before he leaves ” A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants  “One of these will lead you out ”
            I stood  and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door  I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her  He stood to go  but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment  I turned back to the door  “Come on  Amy ” I said  “he’ll be along soon ”
            Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall  When we got there  another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood  He offered it to Nepthys  who opened the box  on velvet lining  a wooden hammer and two stakes  
            “Mountain ash ” said Nepthys  “That was very kind of her ” Closing the box  he paused beside the open door and looked back at me  “I really hope we find your Rachel ” he said  It looked like he was going to continue  but then he walked out the door 
            “I know a quick way to Dvorov’s ” said Nepthys  “I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me ” In a few minutes  we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us  The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart 
            “Yo  my man Nep! You got the sucker already?”
            “No  but we got a tip that he might be in your club  Have you seen him?”
            “Here  man? You’re crazy  I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him  “Anyway  long time  man ”
            “That’s odd  Do you mind if we check it out anyway? I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere ”
            Dvorov glanced over his shoulder  a little nervous  “I guess  man  but be quick  I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong  you know?”
            “Of course  We’ll be in and out in a minute ” Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor 
            “So did you get anything out of the guy I sent you to?” Dvorov asked us 
            “No  he said that his research was purely academic  not for hunters ”
            “Bummer  I guess I probably should’ve known  though  I mean  he is kinda tight about that stuff ” He didn’t look very surprised  “Anyway  this is the dance floor  man  Good luck ”
            Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd  which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before  Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking 
            I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd  Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me  pressing me into the wall  but I took a breath and kept moving  My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat  The music began to build  and a strobe came on  Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor  I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second  I was back with my family in Russia  hiding from the cold  Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me  I gathered her under my arm  Dvorov was somewhere behind me  too  negotiating delicately through his patrons  
            Just in front of me  a massive thing slammed into the wall  sending up a cloud of granite dust  It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf  Its haunches twitched in time to the music  As it started to rise  a man with thick  scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him  I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor 
            Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers  I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this  I wasn’t sure that I could survive the crush of the crowd  A cold thing with countless  writhing tentacles fell against me  thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose  tripping me and clutching at my limbs  A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me  fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing  Then a looming shape to my right fell away  and I saw him in a flash of the strobe  his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd  The creature blocking my vision moved back  but I had seen all that I needed to see  
            A bleeding  eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me  but I ducked around it and toward the bar  I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before  a mountain of wet  veined flesh  and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm  
            It was Dvorov  He pulled my ear down to his mouth  “You seen enough  man?” he shouted 
            “Yes ” I called back  “I saw him! He’s sitting right there at the bar!”
            Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd  but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing  “I don’t think he’s there ” Dvorov shouted to me  “It must have been wishful thinking ”
            “No  I saw him! I have to hurry  too! Who knows how long he’ll stick around?”
            “Listen  man  he’s not there! I’m telling you  it’s not even worth checking the bar!” I turned to keep going  but he caught my arm again  “Don’t do this  kid! It’s a dumb idea  Even if you did find this vampire cat  he’d tear you apart! If he got your girl  she’s probably dead!” I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs  getting almost to the edge of the dance floor 
            Suddenly  Amy screamed  I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away  His eyes were glowing red  and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off  The dancers near us tried to clear some space  He shot back up  hardly touching the ground  and I kicked him back  He jumped at my arm while I was still off balance  and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself 
            A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up  On the floor was Dvorov’s head  separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood  Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand  It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood 
            “He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two ” he said by way of explanation  “You spotted our boy  didn’t you? I bet his hide out is nearby  too  Let’s hurry ” He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip  The crowd parted for us 
            The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us  In a blink of the strobe light  he was on his feet and dashing from the room  “Come on!” shouted Nepthys 
            We chased after him  Amy keeping up valiantly behind us  He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall  and we chased up after him  heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held  Luckily  the vampire turned off after three stories  He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors  but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me  I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us  Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment  Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room  then made a turn out of sight  
            When I came to the door at the end of the room  it looked like it had been torn off its hinges  I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it  and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him  
            A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral  The vault rose into obscurity above me  and a massive rose window stood ahead of me  The panes looked dyed black  and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter  Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber  and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere  I couldn’t tell how many people were running  much less where they were  On the steps in front of the altar  I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women  Then I heard Nepthys shout  “Nathan! Behind you!” I whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head  leaping like a panther  He smashed into the pews behind me and I heard him leap across the rest of the row  There was Nepthys  on the other side of the pews  holding the wooden box in his hand  He tossed it to me  and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again  turning to face me 
            I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes  He leapt over the pews  soaring like a grasshopper  and drew a gleaming knife in midair  I dodged  but he tossed it  and I held the box in front of my face  The blade lodged in the wood  its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin  My arms shook from the force of his throw  Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand  His first move pulled out the dagger  almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box  and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards  I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer  ready to drive the ash spike into his heart  Behind him  I saw Nepthys running between the pews  I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me  I raised the stake  he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine  The stake went down  there was a blur  and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw 
            Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant  then all went numb  Taste  hearing and touch became a single blur  and I do not know if my eyes were open  My mind began to dissipate  but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said  “This one’s blood isn’t worth drinking ” Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack 
            I must have fallen to the floor then  I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me  and I heard steel crack  then bone  I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me  Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar 
            I was content to let myself drift away  and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek  A girl’s voice  soft and almost recognizable  spoke  “Nathan ” I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected  Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake 
            I stood and turned toward the altar  The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me  I stepped up behind him and raised my hands  which almost seemed to be glowing  Then the stake came down into his back and one  two  three strikes with the hammer drove it in  The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth 
            Behind me  Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys  whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug  I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar 
            Rachel  her clothes torn and her face drawn  looked like she might cry when she saw me  I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me  “My fuckin’ hero ” she whispered

            Captured Moments by Will Shetterly
            
                 I remember Papa s stopbox  a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home
                    for his birthday  It was huge and inefficient  and she should never have spent
                    so many pesos on a toy  but Papa would not let her return it  He used it to
                    preserve baby tomatoes  cucumbers  and strawberries in translucent cubes that he
                    stored in the pantry for spring time meals in the middle of winter  Mama kept
                    her mink jacket  a family hand me down  safe from time in a stopbox  and lent
                    the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection  Sometimes they would let us
                    little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we
                    begged them for its release  usually a few hours after enclosing it  
                 When my father died  a year after my mother  my sisters and I cleaned out their
                    apartment  We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes  I took mine home 
                    where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play  One night when
                    I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone  I used my own capturador  a
                    sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora  to undo the stopbox  Bringing my face close
                    to the shoes  I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing
                    up that symbol of their love for me  
                 The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they
                    were encased  But as soon as I coughed  I laughed  and I did not try to kill
                    myself that night  
            
            
                Let me begin again  
            
            
                 I like life on the resort worlds    always have and  after the upcoming
                    mindwipe  always will  Last year  I rented a small house on Vega IV  a sea
                    world  all islands and reefs and archipelagos  turquoise waters and aquamarine
                    skies  sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova  There s
                    only one city  called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la
                    Humanidad  it s N apulco to the locals  The N apulcans are mostly emigrants from
                    Polaris II  the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is
                    that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists  Now the N apulcans profit from their
                    Hispanic siblings  
                 I don t mean to sound cynical  I suppose I wish to show that I m still capable
                    of a certain authorial distance  a semblance of dispassionate observation  The
                    following events may indicate otherwise  
                 In fine tourist tradition  most homes on Vega IV are named  Mine was The
                    Sleeping Flamingo  and its outer walls were coral pink  Were they
                    mood sensitive  they would have changed as I first viewed them  The rental
                    agent  an attractive N apulcan named Tasha Cortez  was not mood sensitive
                    either  She said   It s beautiful  isn t it  Señor Flynn?  
                 My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat
                    and take me elsewhere  But she was young and attractive  as I have said and may
                    say again  and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn
                    that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism  And then  because a
                    playwright cannot resist a promising line  I said   Your Sleeping Flamingo
                    should be put to sleep   
                 To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature   Allow me
                    my self indulgences as you would those of a dying man    when I convince my
                    mindsmith to permit the wipe  there will be another Bernardo Flynn  one who
                    knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here   Her brows drew
                    together  creasing the lovely  caramel colored skin around her eyes and showing
                    the pattern for an old woman s wrinkles on her forehead  Her lower lip  a trifle
                    too narrow for her face  perhaps her only physical flaw  thrust forward slightly
                    as she started to speak  She caught herself  slid her jaw infinitesimally back
                    into place  and said   You don t like it?  
                 I laughed  What could I do? I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at
                    her   Like it? I hate it  despise it  abhor it! It s gaudy  graceless 
                    pretentious    That house is an affront to taste and intelligence  I should buy
                    it to raze it  but I am not so kind hearted  I might  however  rent it   
                 I think she only heard the last words of my speech   You will?  
                  It amuses me  Show me around  and then I shall decide   
                  Of course  Señor Flynn   
                  And stop calling me  señor   Not even Los Mundos is so polite  Call me
                    Bernardo   
                  If you wish   
                  I beg you  change the color of the walls  at the very least   
                  But of course!  The house walls shifted from pink to lavender  
                 I stared  
                  How s that?  
                 I looked at her  
                  Worse?  
                 I nodded   I would not have thought it possible   
                 She frowned   It is rather ugly   
                  Thoroughly ugly   I corrected with smile  
                  Obscenely ugly   said she  smiling too  
                  No   I pointed   It has no tower   
                  I can fix that   She reached for another dial on the house controls  
                  Don t you dare!  Her wrist  when I grabbed it  was smooth and strong and warm
                    in my fingers   I ll take it  Exactly as it is   
                  You will?  
                  I must  God knows what you might do to it next   Reluctantly  I released her
                    hand  
                 The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise  Cloudwood had been used in
                    a Mediterranean manner  making the house seem primitive and civilized at the
                    same time  The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired  From the
                    living room  the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha
                    asked if I felt ill  All I could say was   No  I m in love   We both thought I
                    referred to the vista  
            
            
                 It s strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life 
                    forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one
                    would remember  and suddenly the forgotten  in revenge  rears up to savage the
                    unwary  So it was as I wrote the preceding  My heart convulsed  and I left this
                    manuscript for a three day spree  Apparently I was so successful that it lasted
                    a week and a half  Not bad for an eighty three year old  even for one who has
                    his rejuve every month  And if I can brag and digress so easily  this must not
                    be painful enough to merit a mindwipe  yes? 
                 No  I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately 
                    thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them 
                    even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight  My mindsmith is not
                    so understanding  She says I am emotionally a child  to which I reply   Of
                    course  Why else would I come to you?  This logic does not soothe her  she says
                    I must wait three weeks  Three!  Such is the law  I say I do not care about law 
                    I care about service and she should care about money  Enough  I went on a spree 
                    and it must have been a good one  I hope the wipe is as successful with my time
                    on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here  I dimly remember three bedpartners
                    who were probably human  and one that I hope was delirium  I will not answer the
                    phone for a week  no matter whose face appears on it  
                 I keep evading the issue  But which issue? The issue of why I am evading the
                    issue  or the issue itself? To deal with the first  it hurts to remember  If I
                    am capable of love  I loved Tasha Cortez  If I am not  I had the perfect mirror
                    for my narcissism  
                 As for the issue itself  I m no longer sure what I want to record  The
                    playwright in me wants every scene of our time together  The editor says no 
                    only those that are relevant  The sufferer says no  only those which cause no
                    pain  And the artist says no  only those which cause the most pain  for those
                    would be the truest memories  
                 So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise  I will not talk of the
                    first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together  I can remember
                    similar things with others  Tasha s witchery lay in making old acts new  Is that
                    love? Probably not  But it is something marvelous and rare  which is surely a
                    sign of love  
                 If my love for her was the only important thing  I would leave a holo of her
                    with a note   Dear Future  this is Tasha Cortez  You loved her  With warmest
                    regards  Your Past   
                 Enough  Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together  and I decided
                    to buy it  Then    
            
            
                 This is not easy  I stand up  I walk around  I pretend someone makes a vid about
                    a writer and I must enact every cliche  I cannot decide what s important  But I
                    have learned something  writing trivializes  The Tasha who was is not the Tasha
                    in this file  The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I
                    knew  The Tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour 
                    including commercials  and just before an ad for Figuero s Flash Diapers   
                    Keeps Baby Driest!  she    
                 Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV  I must also write about
                    Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez  
            
            
                 Future Self  you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between
                    the last sentence and this  Not another spree   at least  not like the other  I
                    have been re reading all our favorite books    
                 But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects  do we? 
                 I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo  and
                    then  for the sake of literary convenience  to say that from a corner of the
                    yard I saw a neighboring house  and the sight filled me with darkest
                    forebodings  But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where
                    it could barely be seen  and I only felt envy that it had been designed by
                    someone with understated good taste   Who lives there?  I asked  
                  No one   Tasha replied  
                 Truth is always more boring than fiction  For Malaquez did not move into Dream s
                    End until four or five months after I    we? how does one speak to one s future
                    self?    occupied The Flamingo  
                 I do not plan to write a book  this narrative must move more quickly  Tasha and
                    I became lovers that evening  after a good dinner of paella at her apartment  I
                    made some small joke afterward  about approving of her firm s business
                    incentives  and she cried  Consoling her  I began to suspect I loved her  I
                    moved into The Flamingo the next day  and she gave up her apartment three weeks
                    later to join me  It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most
                    people believe it does not happen at all  the sort of romance that sustains the
                    hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love   Which is to
                    say  you and me  Future Self   
                 Who was Tasha Cortez? She was a twenty four year old  Terran Standard  N Apulcan
                    who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt s real estate
                    firm  Her family said she did it to support her father  who was dying of a
                    particularly painful degenerative disease  Tasha said she woke up one morning
                    convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables  she would become
                    one  
                 She did not like my plays  I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing
                    and not  as I had hoped  because I was a great artist  That bothered  yes  and
                    intrigued  me until I realized that she was bored by most plays  movies  and
                    vid  She did not like being a spectator  I often told her that she should have a
                    bio check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance  I often told her
                    too many things  
                 Search  Emiliano Malaquez  and you ll find he s a master of the  captured
                    moment  school of sculpture  Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work 
                    To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living
                    models  He accents the illusion of reality   I paraphrase his entry in La
                    Enciclopedia Humanica   by doing life size scenes in  the full round   never the
                    easier frontal or three quarters view  Moreover  he never did portraits of
                    famous people  his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared
                    to it  As is typical of his school  his pieces are sealed in stopboxes  The
                    shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we re looking at an
                    instant snatched from under the hooves of time  They say the cubes will outlast
                    planets and suns  that when the universe dies  the works of Malaquez and his
                    followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of God s eye  
                 Yes  Self  I am also bothered that this observation ignores half eaten cheese
                    sandwiches  incomplete insect collections  and locks of infants  hair  forgotten
                    in closets  basements  and warehouses  
                 You see the inspiration for my latest play   Captured Moments   The mindwipe
                    will take its creation from my future self   but time too often does that
                    without aid  The play s second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha
                    and me  I have disguised us in the play  and deleted one brief melodramatic
                    interchange  Now I will mention it  in case I You decide to restore it  Shortly
                    before she left  Tasha said   You steal from life for art  Bernardo  You ll
                    impoverish yourself   I only snarled at her and    
                 My story leaps ahead of itself  Let me retreat and retrench  
                 One night during N apulco s mild winter  Tasha returned to The Flamingo  saying 
                     Nardo! Nardo! Guess what?  
                 My mind was on other things   You wish to become pregnant? I suppose I could
                    assist a friend  Purely for the sake of the race  of course     
                  Ever the altruist  Still  if I do decide  we could practice     
                 Later  I said   You ve been chosen to succeed the Emperor   
                  What?  
                  My guess   
                 She batted at my nose like a cat   Silly Nardo   
                  Then I give up   
                  Emil Malaquez is buying the house up the hill   
                  Oh   
                  You don t know who he is?  
                  Well     
                  Nardo!  One of the many things I liked about her was that she often thought me
                    shockingly ignorant  
                  That s  uh     I am never so quick witted in person as I am on the page 
                    Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant  
                  You know  the sculptor  He s had shows in Brazil and New Madrid and everywhere!
                    He may be more famous than you   
                  Imagine that   I remembered an article in The Medusa and a photo of a work in
                    which 100 peso notes fell like confetti onto a small Undersider  sexlessly young
                    in grimy  oversized clothing  The child s face was a warground for wonder and
                    mistrust  Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal
                    threads in the fluttering pesos  The stars themselves might have fallen on the
                    Undersider and the event would have been no less strange  no less miraculous   A
                    great artist will grace this world  then?  
                  Nardo!  She was never tolerant of my ego  
                  Well  What s this more famous than me person like?  
                  I didn t meet him  jealous old one   
                  Too bad  If I thought he could free me from you     
                  Hah!  She wrapped her arms around my stomach   You ll never be free of me  old
                    man!  
                 The next evening  she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing
                    sushi  sashimi  oysters in their shells  and Terran vegetables fresh plucked
                    from their hydroponic beds  Wondering about the reason for her extravagance  I
                    asked how work had gone that day  
                  Emil came in  He s taking Dream s End   
                  Emil?  
                  You ve no memory left  old one  Emil Malaquez   
                  Ah  You did that to test my affections   
                  What?  
                  Calling him by his first name  I did that in a comedy once  Nights with Karl
                    and Groucho   It was before your time   
                  Oh   
                  The critics liked it   
                  I m glad   A moment later   That s not why I called him  Emil    
                  No?  
                  No  We lunched together  He s nice   
                  Oh   
                  It wasn t like that   
                  You re free   
                  Of course  Still  it wasn t like that  You think I sleep with every famous
                    person I meet?  
                 As you may have guessed  we had talked about such things  I do not claim ours
                    was a perfect affair  only a wonderful one  
                  Tasha     
                  Do you?  
                  No   
                  Good  I invited him to dinner tomorrow   
                  Oh?  
                  He ll be our neighbor  You say we re becoming too insular  that we need to
                    socialize     
                  I ve socialized for sixty three years   
                  Nardo?  
                  Yes?  
                  How should I reply?  Her voice had grown quiet  and I began to feel some guilt 
                    I had  it is true  told her that we needed other company than our own  I said
                    this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel 
                    But knowing this did not mean I wanted it  
                 I said   Truthfully   It was the statement of a younger and crueler man than I  
                 She screamed   I haven t socialized with Terra s elite for most of my life! I
                    haven t socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life! And I invite a
                    neighbor  one nice  lonely man     
                  I m sorry   
                     who took me to    What?  
                  I m sorry  Truly   
                  Oh   She studied me as a suspicious puppy might  then said   I m sorry  too   
                  I suppose I sound like I m bragging when I talk of the things I m tired of   
                  Only because you are   She smiled  
                 I had to grin  so I did   True   
                  He may come to dinner?  
                  If you wish  he may be dinner   
                  I love you   
                  And I  you   Months earlier  we might have sought a bed  a couch  or a
                    comfortable chair at this point  Instead  I asked   Is he handsome?  
                  You re jealous   
                  A tiny bit  Extremely   
                  Content yourself  old one  He s four inches shorter than I  his nose is big and
                    broken  and     
                  This is cosmetic?  
                  He s not that ugly  I think they re his natural features   
                  Interesting   
                  You could write a play about someone like him   
                  Perhaps   
                  I think his face is his form of vanity  It s the reverse of you with those
                    ridiculous stomach muscles  Old men should be fat   
                  Is Emil?  
                  Yes   
                  I am jealous  I ll eat two dinners tonight  Five deserts   
                 She giggled  And then we did make love  
            
            

                 I ve been thinking about the mindwipe  now two days away  Who said that those
                    who forget the past are doomed to repeat it? I fear that may be true for me  Add
                    this to the reasons I write now  to remember something  perhaps even to learn    
                 Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown  carrying a small package wrapped in what
                    looked like real paper  His evening dress was formal  expensive  and slightly
                    stained  as that of all forgetful artists should be  He was a jovial man with an
                    easy laugh  and even uglier than Tasha had suggested  I liked him immediately  
                  Señor Malaquez?  
                  Please  Call me Emil  You must be Bernardo  Tasha s told me much about you   
                  All of it outrageous praise?  
                  All of it   
                  Ah  she is wonderfully perceptive   
                 He raised an eyebrow  then guffawed   Has she said as much about me?  
                  She thinks you are a genius  Do come in   
                  Thank you   Stepping into the living room  he said   A beautiful house   
                  I m glad you came after dark   
                 Tasha  by accident or design  had found an innocently erotic posture on the
                    couch  where she lay with a book of M duvian prints   Emil!  She leapt up   I
                    did not expect you     
                  So early?  
                     on time  It s unforgiveable  but you re forgiven   She nodded at the
                    package   What s that?  
                  For your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home   He held it out  and
                    with a delighted  Oh!  Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper  
            
            
                 I stopped writing  and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me
                    from another spree  I went walking  but after N apulco  Rio seems no fit abode
                    for a creature of flesh  I walked from this hotel to the old city  past the end
                    of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard  cracked pavement of City Park  But
                    Undersiders left me alone  Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost  So I
                    returned  and slept  and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away  
            
            
                 The side of Malaquez s parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen
                    of solid air  Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a
                    friend or a bringer of food  Tasha oohed in awe  I said   Frodo s been visiting
                    you  eh?  
                 Malaquez said   Your pet?  
                  Hardly  He lives around here somewhere  I suppose he was attracted to the
                    commotion up the hill   
                  Ah   Malaquez said   Why  Frodo ?  
                 Tasha said   A little fellow with big  furry feet  What else could he be
                    called?  She handed the sculpture to me  
                 I almost dropped it  I expected it to weigh no more than a holo   Heavy   I
                    said  as if he might not have known  
                 He laughed   My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash
                    fire  Be glad someone didn t toss that to you   He spoke of his art with the
                    enthusiasm of a seven year old   Um  I should wait to importune you  but     He
                    grinned shyly   A confession  and then a request  And then you must forgive me
                    for being so forward  It s not easy for me to ask a favor   
                  Relax   I said   It s easy for me to turn one down   
                 He glanced at me and decided I was joking  The surprising thing is that I was 
                     Good  My last show     
                     was glorious!  Tasha said  
                     was kindly received   he said   But an artist who would stay first among his
                    fellows can tell when he begins to fail   
                  Oh?  I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays  
                  I must change my subject matter  No more urchins  dopers  vagrants  or whores 
                    I want to do more traditional portraits   He spoke quickly  prepared to be
                    rejected   Would you permit me to do one of you? I would pay     
                  Never   I said  
                  Ah   He shrugged lightly  
                  Nardo!  Tasha said   It s an honor     
                  Of course   I said   That s why I cannot take payment   
                  Oh? Oh! Thank you!  Malaquez turned to Tasha   And you as well? Perhaps the two
                    of you together?  
                 Her eyes became circles at the idea of being  as she undoubtedly thought it 
                    immortalized by Emil Malaquez  Catching herself  she said casually   Oh     And
                    then she smiled  laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think
                    how much I loved her  and said   My God  yes  yes  yes!  For a perfect moment 
                    Emil and Tasha and I were one entity  laughing until our lungs hurt  
                 This is torture  I had not considered that I might not write to learn  but to
                    punish myself  Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in
                    a few sentences  After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me 
                    we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder  lobsters boiled on Terra and
                    unstopped still steaming on N Apulco  and cinnamon custard for desert  Then we
                    went out for a late swim  
                 I had drunk too much  I confess  though we all had  Somehow  Tasha and I began
                    to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz  as inconsequential a topic as I can
                    imagine  She had studied it in school  so she thought herself as an expert  I
                    once had a neighbor who played it constantly  loudly  and badly  so I thought I
                    knew it better  Malaquez tried to mediate  but I saw him as siding with Tasha 
                    So  I think  did she  The subject shifted from music to Tasha s obsession with
                    fame  undoubtedly by a leap that I made  She had no choice but to follow   I do
                    not remember any of this well  just now  nor do I care to  Those who are truly
                    curious may look at the last act of  Captured Moments    I remember suggesting 
                    with characteristic tact  that she add Emil to her small list of major
                    accomplishments  
                 Malaquez glanced away  embarrassed  Tasha looked at me as if to say   I will  
                    She said   I feel sorry for you  Nardo  I ll see Emil home   
                  Yes   I said   Do that   and did not care what she did  or why  
                 Emil asked   You re all right?  I muttered something he must have interpreted as
                    assent  They both walked up to Emil s home while I watched the scarlet moonlight
                    ripple on distant waves  Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself  I
                    finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping
                    Flamingo to drink myself to sleep  
                 She had not come home when I woke in mid morning  I waited  and drank a glass of
                    MorningAfter and three cups of coffee  and wondered whether our affair could
                    survive the events of the night  and whether I wanted it to  Perhaps I should
                    have invited Emil to stay  but even then I knew that sex was not the problem
                    between Tasha and me  The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between
                    compromise and capitulation  between symbols and substance  Shortly before noon 
                    I climbed the sandy path to Dream s End  rehearsing my apology  slowing only to
                    pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet  
                 Malaquez answered the door in blood red pajamas and a black silk robe  Sixty
                    years ago in a similar situation  I had broken my knuckles on someone s face  I
                    merely said   Is Tasha here?  
                 He pursed his lips slightly  then nodded   Yes   
                  May I see her?  When he hesitated  I said   Last night was my fault  I hold it
                    against neither of you  Please  Let me talk to her   
                  I     
                  Please   
                 He looked me and at last said   Very well   
                 We walked through his house in silence  It was as attractive and as impersonal
                    as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste  A tall  narrow
                    stopbox stood in the center of one room  sand trickled forever downward while
                    beads of water splashed across the sand s path  If that was Malaquez s work  it
                    was a very minor effort  But then  I was in no mood to consider art  I only
                    wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover  That was easier than
                    despising myself  
                 He paused before a bedroom door   I should go in first  To prepare her   
                 I smiled   She handles surprise surprisingly well   
                  What would it hurt?  
                  True  Go ahead  Tell her     I shrugged   Tell her I love her   
                 He studied me  then said   I m sorry things happened this way  Bernardo  I
                    didn t anticipate last night     
                  I m very good at making things happen this way  But if Tasha will forgive me
                        
                 He nodded  repeated   I am sorry   then slipped into the next room  I waited in
                    the dark  carpeted hall  A warm breeze came from silent vents above me  I heard
                    no voices until Malaquez said   Enter   
                 I blinked when I opened the door  Sunlight filled Malaquez s bedroom  Tasha lay
                    sprawled nude on a rumpled bed  Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the
                    bed s teak frame  She was looking slightly to my left  smiling with trust and
                    satisfaction like one sexually content  Malaquez stood near her  pointing
                    something at my chest  Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them  it
                    shimmered around Tasha  
                 The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great
                    Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor  Malaquez was not prepared for me to
                    react so quickly  or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not
                    have  a gesture I would not make  a poignant moment of repentence  wonder 
                    despair  or love  Had he been faster  he could have had rage  I threw a chair at
                    him  As he fell  I scrambled onto him  my knees pinning his arms  my fingers
                    probing his neck  
                 I shouted   Where is she? Tell me  or I ll kill     
                 He began to cry   She left  Earlier this morning     
                 Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed  I hit him with the back of my
                    hand   Tell me  Malaquez   
                  She wanted to be famous  She did! Now she will be   
                 He seemed to expect me to understand   Where!  I demanded  squeezing his throat
                    until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture  
                 I stared at the naked Tasha  Most of his story I have pieced together since  but
                    I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy
                    throat  He had made his name with a home capturador  He began with small animals
                    and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders  people who would never be missed  Now
                    he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me  and when someone came
                    looking  he would say we had gone island hopping in our windboat  Our boat would
                    disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose  His
                    story would stand in either case  
                 I wanted him to tell me more  but he babbled  begging me to forgive him  to
                    understand  I did not listen  I took the capturador  a matte black Tiempo
                    Capturado  from his grip and studied it  not really thinking about it or
                    Malaquez or Tasha  I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was
                    art  so we accepted it as art  Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that
                    humanity made that would outlive our species  But I was probably only looking at
                    my reflection in the capturador s lens  Had he said then that I should use it on
                    myself  I might have  
                 That moment passed  I looked at Malaquez  His eyes opened wider while we watched
                    each other  His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound 
                    I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha s crypt  She smiled in trust or
                    pleasure or pride  an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever  and I could
                    never know why  
                 The controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model 
                    but I recognized the unstop tab  I could free Tasha  If I did  one of three
                    things would happen  Most likely  she would be meat   there is a reason why
                    stopboxes are most often used in kitchens  Less likely  she would live the rest
                    of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug s  And the tiniest chance of
                    all  she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil s bedroom  and then
                    she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal  
                 As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha s stopbox  I heard Malaquez
                    run for the door  
                 It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we
                    should hate  Know this  my future self  Thanks to us  Emil Malaquez s name will
                    live as long as his masterpiece   A Self Portrait  Anguish   endures  
                 And Tasha? I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate 
                    I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame  some
                    critics already say  Waking With Tasha  is Malaquez s finest work  If science
                    finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil s art  perhaps the I who reads
                    this file will know that my decision is wise  But I cannot stop thinking that I
                    was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death  My fear is that she
                    would live  and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez
                    translated her into a thing that can be kept  admired  and loved  
                 For in my way  I have done the same thing  
                 I am ready for the mindwipe now  

            
        
    


   
      
         
            
            
            The Black Willow
            
            Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close  Opening a side drawer  he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot  After filling his pen  Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk s right hand corner  His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page  echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern s struggling glow  The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds  casting its bone pale glow onto the pine floorboards 
            Allan unfolded another page  this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right  The lines of letters stepped into their divisions  in the shape of a story s outline  the loose  dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet  awaiting tendons  muscle and blushing skin  Allan reviewed the troops  all prepared to disembark  their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to be  thus upsetting the apple cart of his life s plan  clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best 
            Although the concept was a simple one  Allan thought it had potential  Besides  the public liked a good  simple romance  Perhaps this will be more saleable  he thought and began to write 
            
            They gazed at each other  lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before   What about Roger?  she asked  knowing that the answer no longer mattered 
            
            This is good  he thought  pausing to raise the low light of the lantern  I m almost done  and the happy ending is just falling into place  I hardly dare to think it  but – I may finish this story!
            As he thought this  a sinuous wind encircled the house  slipping through the walls to chill him  The papers and the lantern s flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan s window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door  This was no stranger  however  the twisted  ancient thing was older than Allan  its branches rapping on his window since his childhood  Its thin  drawn fingers framed the bloated moon  whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly  The great  jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author  who gazed up through his window s tiny frame with trepidation  Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him  His pen flickered forth  words dancing out from its nib  In the author s eye gleamed the lantern s reflection – or was it a reflection? For while the lantern s spark shivered in the chill breeze  this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner s pen  scratching out the rhythm of the willow s fingers 
            
            The frenzied writing ceased at last  the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort  He held a hand to his forehead  eyes closed and face flushed  I did it again  he thought  After all that – so near the end  to lose control again  His breath returning to its normal rhythms  he dared to look at the page before him  
            His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears  he draped his loose cape over her shoulders   Come  darling   he whispered   Where I am to take you  one need never think of those left behind   
            They stepped together into his carriage  her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt  conveyed as if through her skin  the unearthly nature of the rails and reins  the wheelspokes  They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting  For a few yards  they kicked up dust along the roadway  then they raised their hooves and took to the air  She gaped  afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand  The New England woods disappeared  even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky  Above them  the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached  A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky s glory 
            
            Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window   Damn you   he cried   will you never leave me be? Shall I never finish a story in peace?  He pounded his desk in vain  cursing the foul muse that drove him 
            
            The next day  Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well furnished parlor  Taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass  he glanced at his host – a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns – who passed him a silver tray  
             Cucumber sandwich? 
            Allan took a sandwich between his fingers   Thank you  Arthur  
            Arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber  In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial  he refilled their glasses   How is the writing these days  my dear Mr  Clemm? 
             Perfectly dreadful  my dear Mr  Mason   Allan sighed   I had a perfect story in my pages  my hero returned home and reclaimed his love  I nearly had it tied together before… 
             Before? 
             Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others  thank Heaven  
            Arthur s face assumed a long suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation   I m not familiar with Mr  Poe s works  but I assume you re referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic  
             It s far from a  penchant   Arthur  This is more like a compulsion  a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment  then leaps and takes ahold of me  screaming out through my quill  
             How perfectly awful   Arthur grimaced at the vivid description   I m sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption  
             I know   Allan replied   but how am I to do that? You know I do not wish to make my stories thus  but it is my nemesis  confronting me anew at every turn! 
            Arthur raised a critical brow   Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy  Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal  and believe me  Allan  you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish  There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience  at least  
             It is true   Allan admitted  fidgeting with his cufflinks   that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher  I ve even tried rewriting the corrupted sections  but once my characters have gone down that road  nothing can recall their former life  My prodigal ink blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road  
            Arthur sighed and sipped his wine   If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours  you might write something really worth reading  It s hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print  like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd  
            Allan hung his head  holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees  His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night  and his clothing had a rumpled look as if  by mere proximity  it had taken on the aspect of his weariness  He scratched the back of his dark haloed head and blinked bleary eyes   I would drive it out   he said softly   but I fear for what would remain  
             Perhaps you require a rest from writing   suggested Arthur   You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat  improve your disposition  
             Perhaps it would   Allan replied  rising and vainly straightening his suit   I shall consider it  in the meantime  however  I must be off  You have been a gracious host  as always  
            Arthur rose and shook his hand   So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home   he said   I hope soon to see you in better sorts  
            They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur s gate  He walked the wheel ruts  hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust  Some quarter mile from Arthur s gate  he halted  confronted by a halloo   Nathan?  he called out to the empty road 
            The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree   I had a hunch you d be at Arthur s today   said Nathan   so I thought I d wait here for you   Nathan s lanky frame  dressed in a loose  tan jacket  fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton  His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface  infusing his body with a rakish energy   So  Allan   said Nathan  unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside   how goes life for the quintessential American author?  
             I wouldn t know   replied Allan dryly  before continuing in another tone entirely   I destroyed another story last night  Nathan  
            Leaning against his tree  Nathan shook his head   You mean  finished another story  
             Yes  it is finished! Ended! Never again shall it see the rosy fingered dawn! Nathan  you ve read these abominations of mine  You know just as well as I that they have no future  no potential  At best  they are faery tales  at worst  expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see  
             So instead  you would write – what? 
             Something saleable  something worth reading  worth writing! I want to write as others do  a tale  set in our real world  of characters who might live therein  not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars! 
             Why is that more desirable than what you write today? 
             People will read such stories  they are worth publishing  
             If you never finish such stories  how can they be worth publishing? 
             That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct! 
             Why do you write? 
             …Why – to earn a living  I suppose  Why do you ask? 
             You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter  though you face such difficulty  Why is that? 
             I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft  I would not be happy  thus separated from it  
             So at its heart  then  your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself? 
             Yes  I suppose one could see it thus  But really  Nathan  your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level  
            Ignoring the statement  Nathan continued   Your writing is for you  Allan  not for the publishers or some imagined audience  Since you seem unable to write  normally   why not embrace your tales as they are  leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure? Your stories strike a chord with the deepest  most ancient stories of mankind  the tales basic to humanity  Tell them  and they will create an audience  You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are  speak  and they shall listen  
            
            Allan crouched over his desk once more  pen in hand and mind blank  He contemplated a story  an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago  He had filled his pen and raised it  the nib descending towards the paper  before the sound came  the gentle  persistent tapping of the gnarled  primeval willow touching the window with long  insistent fingers  
            His eyes awoke with a passionate  determined flame  though the only light came from the glutted moon  Allan filled page after page  the words escaping from his mind onto the paper  Where before they had marched in regiments  practiced in ranks and followed their leaders  commands  the words now escaped in their true forms  unhindered by any stricture  He continued long into the night  until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow  raised perpetually skyward  
            
            Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye 
             What is this?  he queried  indicating the pages he held in his left hand 
             I decided that… since I wasn t having much success with more – traditional – stories  I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely   Allan replied  somewhat less self assured than he had been the previous night  
             What in G d s name could have possessed you to do such a thing   cried Arthur  nearly raising his voice   After all I said the day before  why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self indulgent fantasy?  He shook the papers at Allan  raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son   This is nothing but a glorified Grimm s tale  a miscarried child of Stoker  a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!  He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur s throat   Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?? 
            For a moment  Allan could hardly do more than shake his head   No  of course not… I–  
             Then why   Arthur barreled on   do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble  this morbid  paganistic drivel? Why do you disregard my warnings  my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption  this literary debauchery?  He glared at Allan  eyes impaling him and demanding a response 
             Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window?  Allan cried out at last  stepping forward and casting his arms open  confronting Arthur with this demanding  pleading interrogation   Its twigs rap constantly against the wall  the wind always demanding my attention  How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door? 
            Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author  viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason   A tree? A tree forced you to write this  my dear Mr  Clemm? I must admit  this seems far fetched  even by your standards – even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you  
             You don t know what this is like   said Allan  shaking his head   Nathan would understand completely   Even as he said it  Allan prayed that his statement was true  
             Very well   said Arthur   then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you  If you insist on abandoning me  I shall not hold you   With that  he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room 
            Stunned  Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order  He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken  making his way past his host s doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan s residence  several miles away 
            
            Nathan read the package of words in silence  his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages  Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself  a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period  At long last  Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them  Allan leaned forward unconsciously 
             It s the best story you ve ever written  
            Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair  his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts   So   he asked   you don t think it s a waste of ink and paper  a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery? 
             Heavens  no   said Nathan  aghast   This is one of the strongest works I ve read in ages  It speaks to the deepest storyteller s instinct within us all  yet is entirely original  My dear friend  you have done it  Oh  they may rail against you at first  they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage  but while those in power say such things  others will read your tales and see their true worth  Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now  
            Allan  though dubious as to that possibility  felt some temptation from the compliment  mainly  it granted him the encouragement he still needed  Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him  then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face  He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right  although the man was somewhat peculiar  he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight  Certainly  it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them  His mind s strangest fruit had ripened at last  and he found the taste less bitter than expected  These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home 
            It was evening  and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last  Passionate  fiery colors filled the western sky before him  though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead  As Allan drew closer  he distinguished a new cloud  a pillar rising directly ahead  a road of smoke ascended in the west  its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door 
            Allan s thoughts fled as one  scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume  He ran the last distance  crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below  walking to the carriage parked before Allan s house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle s roof  Arthur paused in the door  looking up at Allan for a moment  then he turned and shut the door behind him  The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on  As they trotted forth  Allan s eyes remained trapped by the carriage  following it up the hillock and past himself  The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows  He watched as the carriage drew still more distant  the horses  hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway 
            When they had gone  he remained  stunned  until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself  He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done 
            Rounding the corner  he saw a great bonfire  A mass of flaming wood stood before him  heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house  It was a moment before he realized what else had changed  near the wall  beneath his window  was a stump with black and ancient bark 
            In a thoughtless panic  Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre  His thoughts were not of the act s futility  nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing  instead  all that filled his mind was the tree s constant presence in his life  growing with him and beside him  its persistent reminders that he had higher  truer things to write  the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake  His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn  burning logs  but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes  tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers 
            But he did not weep  Instead  he bethought himself of the loss of the tree  considered also Arthur s motivation and whether some good might not come of this  after all  Leaving the circle of ashes  he stood and turned towards the woods  in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood  He stepped slowly beneath the branches  a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great  swirling eddy  a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow s last breath  
            Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time  thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog  strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate  He considered Arthur s intervention  considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested  to write stories that others would read  for after all  what purpose writing if not to be read? And without that torturous willow  he might be free to write whatever he saw fit  Indeed  if he still could not  he could at any time follow Arthur s advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality  Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind  He found himself along the bank of a low  wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current  As it turned to the deeper woods  elder giants rose above him  a beech  smooth bark a gray green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark  cracked trunks of the nearer trees  great pines  a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three stroke symbol of the British King  a towering black birch  leaves impossibly high above him  As the stream wound its way through the largest pines  grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings  Allan continued  slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants  There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass 
            Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks  Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped  Before him  roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream  grew a stand of black willows  Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet  the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees  still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers  sprang up where branches reached the ground  Though the elders  trunks fell and died  their children  first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead  continued unabated  a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors 
            Allan stumbled forward  jaw slightly slack  until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted  three trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself  Collapsing at its base  Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan  a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks  falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream  flowing through the ground beneath them 
         
      
   
   


   
   
      
         
            Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime

            There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This
Week this morning  furrow browed and  heartbroken with all the evidence
coming out  against the president  Last week  when the Lewinsky story was only
a few hours old  Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to
demonstrate his concern   These are probably the most serious allegations yet
leveled against the president  There s no question that  if they re true  they
    could lead to impeachment proceedings  

            Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even
disgusting about Stephanopoulos  eager show of independence from the president?
The problem isn t so much his disloyalty  Political figures turn on each other
from time to time  for good and bad reasons  we re used to it  Stephanopoulos
wants to run for the Senate and doesn t want to seem a Clinton stooge  By
lending credence to the Lewinsky charges  and treating Clinton s familiar
defenses as the lies and half lies they seem to be  Stephanopoulos shows he s
not a fool 

            The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in
the first place  During the 1992 campaign  when Gennifer Flowers first brought
Clinton s philandering to public attention  Stephanopoulos  as Clinton s chief
spinner  distracter  and all around bullshit artist  played a crucial role in
discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth  namely
that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem   Don t say Stephanopoulos didn t
know  Again  he s not a fool   Simply put  Stephanopoulos did as much as any
man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments 

            The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on
tape  Early in the film  with the Flowers crisis in full bloom  Sam Donaldson
interviews Stephanopoulos  who blames it all on the  Republican attack
machine    Gov  Clinton has no character problem   Stephanopoulos declares 
Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to
infidelity   He said he had problems in his marriage   says Stephanopoulos 
correcting Donaldson s deviation from the pre scripted fudge phrase of the day 
 Today  of course  the president s defenders claim that Clinton admitted
infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply
didn t care  

            Near the end of The War Room  Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone
who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours  which he is about to
publicize  Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping
quiet   You would be laughed at      he tells the caller   I guarantee you that
if you do this you ll never work in Democratic politics again      Nobody will
believe you and people will think you re scum  

            You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander protection
techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to
not get caught  He was one of Clinton s principal enablers  to use a word
employed by Maureen Dowd in today s New York Times   When Democrats
wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton  they don t need to look much
further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos  Carville  and
a cooperative campaign press corps  helped to put over in 1992 

            Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst 
It s as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid  50s to soberly rue the
damage wreaked by Sen  Joe McCarthy  without any apology for his own role  Much
has been made of the way famous wrongdoers  e g   Dick Morris  Marv Albert 
rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture  But usually at least a nanosecond
of contrition is required  Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going
through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the
country  If Clinton  as is now increasingly clear  was a time bomb waiting to
explode  then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and
muffled the ticking 

         
      
   


   
   
      
         
            Selling Land to Jews

            Last week  a 70 year old
Palestinian real estate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict by
the Palestinian Authority making the sale of Arab owned land to Jews a capital
crime  The issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the
Jewish Arab struggle 

            The
19 th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived of
Zionism   the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of a
Jewish state in the biblical land of Israel  never worked out their ideology s
logistics  Jewish settlement in Palestine  then part of the decaying Ottoman
Empire  only proceeded piecemeal  In the 1880s and 1890s  about 25 000 Jews
immigrated to Palestine  Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the
cities of Jaffa  Tiberias  and Jerusalem  A second wave of 30 000 immigrants
came between 1905 and 1914  many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted the
Jewish state to be socialist  Extolling the virtues of manual labor  they
acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords 
The  New Palestinian Jew    they said  needed to be physically tougher
than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe 

            The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1904 for the
purpose of buying up land from Arabs  After the Ottoman Empire s defeat
in World War I  Britain acquired Palestine and promised  in the Balfour
Declaration  the creation of a Jewish state  In anticipation  Jews in Palestine
began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity  The
Jewish National Fund s charter was amended to mandate that Jewish land could
never be resold to Arabs or opened to non Jewish employees 

            Following
Jewish National Fund guidelines  farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living on
the newly acquired plots  The total number displaced was small  By 1946  Jews
owned only 7 percent of Palestine  but the perceived threat of displacement was
widespread among Arabs  Starting around 1910  Arab newspapers railed against
Jewish land acquisition  Among the peasantry  rumors spread alleging an
Anglo Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine  Anxious to avoid
being blamed for Palestinian landlessness  British officials began imposing
token restrictions on Jewish land purchase in 1940  They publicly supported
Arab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land 

            
Palestinians say evictions destroyed
their way of life  forcing them to move from rural Palestine to crowded cities
in search of work  They also say that the better educated Jewish buyers had
duped illiterate peasants into selling property 

            The Arab
National Fund  created in 1931 by wealthy Arab families to purchase land for
displaced peasants  was ineffective  During the 1930s  Palestinian responses
turned violent   In 1934 Jerusalem s mufti  the spiritual leader of the
city s Muslims  decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other Muslims
who sold land to Jews  Arabs  who outnumbered Jews by more than 2 to 1 
revolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewish
nationhood  About 5 000 Arabs and several hundred Jews were killed in riots and
guerrilla attacks between 1936 and 1939 

            Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the
territory s residents  Jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural
technology   which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with
food to feed the growing Arab population  Zionists also maintain that Jews
became a lucrative market for Arab manufactured goods 

            Some
historians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestine s entry into the
world economy in the 1880s  Urban commerce drew some peasants from their
family farms  Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with
cash crop entrepreneurs  Jews and Arabs  whose successes changed the face of
Palestinian agriculture  Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor 
these historians say 

            
Very little of the land owned today by
individual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase  Jewish
sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are  by
war  Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government  mostly desert
and mountains  after the 1948 War of Independence   Property owned by
Arab refugees  who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the
Israeli army  another long standing controversy   was also taken over by
individual Jews or confiscated by the government  Many Palestinians  however 
stayed put  retained their land  and became Israeli citizens 

            A new
school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by
Jewish land acquisition  and concludes that it was not always fair  One popular
theory compares Zionism s imperative to acquire land to the American idea of
Manifest Destiny  that it was the United States  God given right to rule
from coast to coast   Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish
National Fund to prohibit non Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands 
However  even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict
Muslims from Palestine 

            Israeli security officials believed that the murdered
real estate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authority
police  The Palestinian Authority s decision to make the sale of land to Jews a
capital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land use 
specifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now under
construction in East Jerusalem 

            In the past  death
threats have done little to deter sales of land  According to British land
records  the Jerusalem mufti s 1934 decree failed to prevent sales  But that
decree did not have the power of civil law behind it  Nevertheless  the
incentives to sell at the market price are substantial  and if the threats
create new scarcities  higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload
their land 

         
      
   


   
   
      
         
            Even More  Proving Rape 

            Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page s
coverage of Juanita Broaddrick s rape charges against Bill Clinton  see
 Proving
Rape     More Proving
Rape   as well as Michael Kinsley s
 Readme column in the current issue  cries out for the introduction of the
Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press
responsibility  With that in mind  Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the
Intellectual Dishonesty  henceforth to be known as the Indis  
Index   Here s how it works  Publications that refuse to acknowledge
 even if to refute the importance of  highly significant but inconvenient facts
in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one
point for the initial offense  They will then score one point for
every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense
is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient
fact  and an additional two points on days when the news organization
runs a follow up without making note of said inconvenient fact 
Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of
Fame   Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness
of Joseph Stalin   Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase
 intellectual dishonesty   because it s pompous and falsely suggests that only
intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest  But Chatterbox doesn t know any
other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of
offense  

            For the purposes of this survey  the Wall Street Journal will be
counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal  s
editorial page  because  in essence  it is 

            The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma
Kelsey  the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people
partially corroborating Broaddrick s rape accusation  is the daughter of a man
whose murderer was pardoned by Gov  Bill Clinton   A responsible account of the
whole controversy in today s New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon
had nothing to do with her corroboration   The Journal editorial page
gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op Ed by
Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb  19  Because it has published three times since the
initial omission  it scores an additional three points  And because it
published an editorial Feb  22 taunting the rest of the press for not following
it on the story  and still didn t mention the pardon  it scores an extra
two points  That comes to a total of six   Chatterbox feels
certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow up
tomorrow to tonight s NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview  which
means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it
will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest!

            Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus
points for having  eventually convinced  Broaddrick to grant an interview to
the New York Times  as the Times reports in today s story   But
the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis
Index  s scoring procedures  And besides  Rabinowitz s efforts on the
Times   behalf weren t really unethical  just puzzling  given the two
newspapers  intense rivalry  When Chatterbox asked the Journal  s DC
bureau chief  Alan Murray  who exercised good judgment in not breaking
the Broaddrick story  and  full disclosure   is Chatterbox s former boss   to
comment about a Journal employee s feeding sources to the Times  
he replied   I don t really have any comment on what the edit page did  They do
their thing  we do ours   Which is what Journal news employees are
instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing
embarrassment 

            For her part  Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf
of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them
sound   Ms  Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared
at the house in the a m   and that she had refused an interview   Rabinowitz
writes in an e mail message   I asked her why she had decided to talk to the
New York Post  s Steve Dunleavy  and refused a Times reporter  She
said Dunleavy caught her by surprise  She asked if I thought it would be all
right to talk to the Times reporter  I told her it would be  certainly
as all right as talking to Dunleavy  She said   Well  I m sorry I didn t   She
said she would if he called again  I passed this on to   Times reporter 
Felicity Barringer during our second day s interview chat  So  that s how it
happens that in the New York Times piece today I m
described  solemnly  as having  eventually convinced  her to repeat the story
to the New York Times

            Fetal Viability

             Viability  has become the
focus of the abortion debate  Last week  the Senate rejected Majority Leader
Tom Daschle s bill banning the abortion of  viable fetuses   But William
Bennett and William Safire hailed Daschle s bill as the great compromise that
might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion  Forty one states
already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses  What is a viable fetus? How is
the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of
abortion?

            
               Roe
vs  Wade   the 1973 case legalizing abortion  made fetal viability an
important legal concept   The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put
the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the
fetus is  viable   The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life
outside the mother s womb  It said this included fetuses that doctors expected
to be sustained by respirators  The court accepted the conventional medical
wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a
pregnancy  the third trimester  sometime between the 24 th and
28 th week  a pregnancy usually lasts 38 weeks   Because the point of
viability varies  the court ruled  it could only be determined case by case and
by the woman s own doctor  Even if the fetus is viable  the court said  states
could not outlaw an abortion if the woman s life or health was at stake 

            Justice Sandra Day O Connor argued in a 1983 decision that
Roe was on a  collision course with itself   She said that
improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal
viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy  allowing states greater
opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion  And this seems to be the
case  up to a point  Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the
23 rd week  a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago  Most
hospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of
pregnancy 

            But no
baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the
22 nd week  Babies delivered during the 22 nd and
23 rd weeks weigh just over a pound  Their lungs have barely
formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale  Circulation
depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones  A baby born
during the 22 nd week has a 14 8 percent chance of survival  And
about half of these survivors are brain damaged  either by lack of oxygen  from
poor initial respiration  or too much oxygen  from the ventilator  
Neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the
22 nd week  because before then the lungs are not fully formed 

            
Probability of survival increases for babies
born later in pregnancy  25 percent in the 23 rd week  42 percent in
the 24 th week  57 percent in 25 th week  By the
30 th week  when a newborn doesn t require a ventilator to breathe 
it has a 90 percent chance of survival  And only after the 30 th week
do the risks of long term brain damage begin to substantially subside  Because
premature babies depend on technology  survival rates vary based on access
to that technology   For instance  in rural communities  which commonly lack
expensive infant intensive care units  survival rates in these early weeks are
much lower 

            Doctors
assess a fetus s viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have
formed  Sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetus s weight  which
correlates with the lungs  development  and to look for signs  such as the
development of functioning eyelids and creases in the skin  that
coincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system  None of the
methods for predicting viability are very precise 

            Despite important Supreme Court decisions since 1973
modifying the doctrine of Roe   the court s thinking about fetal
viability has remained fairly constant   The only significant revision
came in the Casey decision  1992   which made viability even more
important  The court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor
to perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an
abortion 

            Forty one
states now have laws restricting post viability abortions  Some allow doctors
to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable  Some require doctors to
perform tests to prove a fetus is pre viable and require multiple doctors to
certify the findings  Eleven states have banned the procedure called intact
dilation and extraction  IDE   also known as partial birth abortion   in
the belief that this procedure is used mainly post viability 

            
Banning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of the
pro life movement  Movement adherents claim that the IDE procedure  in which
delivery is induced  the fetus s skull is crushed  and its brains are
suctioned  amounts to infanticide  Barring this procedure is also the only
regulation of abortion that public opinion polls say has a majority of
support  Pro choicers say the ban on IDEs is inconsistent with Roe  
because the procedure can be used to abort pre viable fetuses 

            Some medical ethicists
and constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create
the pre viability post viability distinction in the first place  Why  they ask 
does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast
medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion
debate  the fetus s own claim to  human ness  and a woman s right to control
her body? Even if viability is an important moral line  is it drawn in the
right place? Keeping alive a baby born in the 22 nd week costs
several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails  regardless of the
effort 

            The fuss over post viability
abortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures  
Less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the
21 st week  In 1992  only 1 070 abortions were performed after the
25 th week 

         
      
   


   
   
      
         
            No More Kisses

            In light of Secretary of State Albright s imminent trip to the middle east 
the New York Times  
Los
Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation
there  But USA Today stays with Princess Di 

            The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday  she will  read
the riot act  to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism  Her goal will
be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel 
telling him that there can be no more attempts at co opting Hamas  and  no more
kisses  of its leaders 

            The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context  Given that the
troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and
Israel  but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi
Arabia  the paper states that the U S  is now facing the prospect that the
moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and
Iran is falling apart 

            The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about
whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon 
dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was
ambushed  with twelve deaths the result  Perhaps the most striking indicator of
a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that
cabinet member Ariel Sharon  who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel
entrenched in Lebanon in the first place  is among those urging a
reconsideration of the deployment 

            Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its
controlling stake of Compuserve  but it s the Post with the news that
AOL is set to take it over 

            The Wall Street Journal  Outlook  observes   In the U S  job
market  the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers   and
states that  the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of
corporate downsizing   which left behind survivors who took stock of career
options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land
better offers  which in turn led to counter offers and higher salaries  This
has led  says the Journal   to annual compensation rising 5 6 percent a
year 

            Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of
meta  and meta meta pieces  The LAT   for instance  examines what it
takes to be a new  cuddly feely  Britain born of the national grief experience 
But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as
well  Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill
ambassador job shortly before her death  and USAT reports that Le
Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family
and children 

            Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page
and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story   Not
everyone in Calcutta  or India for that matter  is unanimous in praising the
nun  whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but
made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this
collapsing city s poor neighborhoods  Salvation  hers and that of the destitute
she rescued from the gutters  was her aim  not economic or social development
as many others understand it  she said   It s odd  however  that in repeating
this charge  the Times didn t interview the man most closely associated
with it  Christopher Hitchens  or refer to the book where he set it out  The
Missionary Position   Hmmm  wanna bet there was a copy of the book on
somebody s desk at the Times though?

            What s with the top of the front headline the LAT puts over its
picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at
the U S  Open   Venus Brought Back to Earth ? Doesn t that sound like
celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd  and a good
illustration of how trying to shoe horn in a  witty  headline can drive you
into an idea that doesn t fit or is undeserved  Given that Ms  Williams 
parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still
pretty lilly white sport  don t be surprised if there s a bit of a complaint
about this 

         
      
   


   
   
      
         
            Husbands and Wives

            Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext
 and hence much of the appeal  of a Hillary Clinton Rudy Giuliani Senate race
would be Wronged Wife vs  Neglectful Husband  By running against Giuliani  who
has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress  he denies it  and 
by all accounts  has a sham marriage   the first lady could exact symbolic
revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the
Democratic party at the same time! That s almost enough for Chatterbox
to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon 

            The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton s
marital problems a major campaign issue   Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a
patsy   cried Time this week  But  er  wouldn t that be kind of a risky
strategy  given his own problematic union? Many have already opined that the
mayor is too vituperative  too much of a loner to practice the congenial 
teamwork oriented politics of the Senate  other doubters have pointed to his
hardhearted  uncaring social policies  The last thing he needs is to draw more
attention to these qualities in his personal life 

            Giuliani s estrangement from his wife  Donna Hanover  is made clear in an
interview with Hanover that appears in today s New York Times   Hanover  would not say
whether Giuliani would run for the Senate  whether she would like him to run
for Senate  or whether she would campaign for him if he did  But she did say in
the interview  which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation
about Hillary Rodham Clinton s interest in the same New York Senate seat  that
Mrs  Clinton is a  very interesting  person   I think she s dynamic  and I
think she s very smart  and she s an amazing speaker   Ms  Hanover said   And 
for a punch line   Ms  Hanover s press secretary  Joannie Danielides  said this
week that Ms  Hanover had no comment on Mrs  Clinton s potential Senate
campaign   Does she have any comment on whether Ms  Hanover plans to be Hillary
Clinton s campaign manager?

            
               Indis Index 
               Update  NBC  in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast
last night  turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by
Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her  This
diminishes   slightly   the significance of Norma Kelsey s possible
motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick s story   One of the three is Kelsey s
sister  whose motives can be similarly questioned  the other two heard
Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip  as only Kelsey and
Broaddrick s husband claim to have   However  Chatterbox notes that NBC  like
every other responsible news organization that s covered this story  reported
that Norma Kelsey s father s killer was pardoned by Gov  Bill Clinton  and
remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won t  Its Indis
Index is today up to seven

            Fashioning Paula

            
               USA
Today leads with Texas  settlement of its product liability lawsuit
against the leading tobacco companies  The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesian
economic crisis  a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast to
a further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns  The New York Times
leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning
abortion 

            In the Texas case  reports USAT   the defendant companies have agreed
to pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it
incurred in the treatment of smoking related illnesses  That makes Texas the
third state to settle such a case  joining Florida and Mississippi  There are 
says the paper  a total of 40 such suits on file  with Minnesota s turn coming
next week 

            The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs  lawyers
hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2 2
billion in fees 

            The NYT abortion survey  the first conducted by the paper since 1989  was
based on telephone interviews of 1 101 people and detects  a notable shift from
general acceptance  of having the procedure  from 40 percent to 32 percent  And
the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion
timing  Sixty one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted
during the first trimester  but only 15 percent in the second and just 7
percent in the third   The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a
focus on partial birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for
abortion foes   Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law on
abortion could not give the correct answer 

            The WSJ notes that the just concluded football TV deal will probably
mean even steeper cable bills in the near future  Some local cable
companies  the paper says  expect the fees they ll pay ESPN to go up more than
20 percent  And they re in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote 
Even nonsports fans will be affected  notes the Journal   because ESPN is
usually part of basic cable service   Which raises the question  Hasn t
technology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria style programming
choices by subscribers? 

            A scan of the headlines found cheek by jowl on the WP  s Page A6
provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer 
  Ex HUD Secretary  Cisneros s Ex Mistress Pleads Guilty     Labor Secretary 
Herman Denies Allegations of Influence Selling Scheme   and  Two Tyson Foods
Executive Indicted Over Gifts to  Ex Agriculture Secretary  Espy  

            The WSJ reports that  according to an MIT survey  Americans are twice
as likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrials
than one for gene cloning research 

            The NYT reports that today s issue of the journal Science will
describe an experiment in which people s biological clocks were reset three
hours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees  The finding  if it
holds up  says the Times   may lead to a simple way for airline travelers
to fight jet lag 

            Yesterday s Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline  Paula
Jones Works on Her Court Appearance   which  illustrated by pictures of Jones 
was all about the various looks she s had since stepping on the public stage 
The piece concluded that she s finally graduated to an image that s
 sophisticated yet soft   Today s WP  Style  section  that s the
opposite of substance  remember  picks up that ball and runs with it  with a
lengthy discourse on the new PJ   It is   hyperventilates
the Post   one of the most jaw dropping public make overs ever   Jones
apparently has  smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to such
dazzling heights  Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural  not neon 
hues  Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarial
pool  She has embraced the markers of dignity  refinement and power   In true
newspaper overkill fashion  the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson 
national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials  and Steven Zdatny  a
historian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics and
politics of hair 

            The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph  but one carrying the
seeds of its own destruction  If people know all this work is going into making
Paula Jones seem a certain someone  doesn t that just make it obvious that
she s really somebody else?

         
      
   


   
   
      
         
            The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna
            

            Dear Joe 

            I know what you mean about being a journalist  Almost every assignment is a
challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier  I often feel as
if I only get half the story sometimes  so I typically do a massive amount of
reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need  I think that is
why I welcomed doing a book  it gives one the ability to use so much of what is
left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism 

            Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we
never add to stories  Most often reporters recount these tales with each other
and with their sources rather than share them with the general public  Much of
it  of course  using the standards of top newspapers  cannot be used since it
is largely gossip we are repeating  although it certainly could make for some
very good stories  I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be
written about this era  probably decades and decades hence as it is too close  
In any case  there certainly is no lack of information available about the
moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons  I would
posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the
current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur 

            So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to
watch  The smart boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully  I
personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just
one man  at AOL  for example  there was a conscious effort to develop other
 characters   for lack of a better word  So there  while you think of Case  you
also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives 
Steve Ballmer  of course  is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft  but
it still seems to be Bill s show over there 

            While I did not attend the trial  I was lucky to be able to read your highly
amusing and informative dispatches  several of which made me spit up my lunch
laughing  it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and
the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good  That s ironic  since I
think it was just that insularity that helped them  much in the same way that
AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon
Valley  AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here  I am sure 
since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati  Out
in the D C  area  they looked positively exciting next to all the
government oriented contractors  I wonder if that means geography is destiny 
and it s still location  location  location 

            From where I am sitting  I think the Microsoft trial has been the really
obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age  I think it
almost does not matter what the judge does since it s clear that the balance of
power is shifting again  although it not clear where it will land  Will the
strongman of the era be AOL  AT&T  Microsoft  or one of the big media
companies? Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and
encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of
businesses where none are allowed to dominate?

            I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company  whether
it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney  is in charge of all our destinies  Babylon
was  That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem
possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire s grip on
humanity  But we all know how that story turned out 

            Now I am getting way too philosophical  but this is my final missive  so why
not? Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going  As for
me  I ll stick with my philosophy of reporting and  I guess  life  nobody
knows 

            Cheers 
Kara

         
      
   


   
      
         
            Red Pants



            While writers whose business it is to be witty
often fail to produce  grave authors occasionally
are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their
minds   From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with
innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind 
I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate
Red Pants items  a sampling of which follows 
My designation derives from a splash of vivid
writing in Francis Thompson s  A Corymbus for Autumn
in which he proclaims how “day s dying dragon”
was


Panting red pants into the West 
            

            In this trousers category  Thompson must share the
limelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla
Khan  


As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing 
            

            Even Shelley may stake a claim  if only in the pajama
division of this sector  thanks to his description in
Epipsychidion of how


    the slow  silent night
Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep 
            

            Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare  it is not
surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has
contributed his own Red Pants nuggets   In Antony and
Cleopatra  Act IV  Scene VIII  lines 14 et seq     Antony
commands the wounded Scarus to


    leap thou  attire and all 
Through proof of harness to my heart  and there
Ride on the pants triumphing 
            

            And in Othello  Act II  Scene I  line 80  Cassio utters
the fervent prayer that Othello might

            Make love s quick pants in Desdemona s arms 

            A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de Céspedes 
The Secret  translated from the Italian by Isabel
Quigly  Simon and Schuster  New York  1958  page
114  where she confides that “I still had a whole afternoon
before me to spend  and I used it to tidy up my
drawers    ”  One may well wonder what Miss Stowe
had in mind when  in Uncle Tom s Cabin  Chapter 5  
she narrates how “Mrs  Shelby stood like one stricken 
Finally  turning to her toilet  she rested her face in her
hands  and gave a sort of groan ”  In this same vein  the
mirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of
nations when  in describing Mount Etna in Book I of
Paradise Lost  lines 236 7  he penned


And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and smoke     
            

            And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair   when Blenkinsop 
the housekeeper  sought to console Amelia for Joe
Sedley s jilting of her dear Rebecca  Thackeray confides
 indelicately?   that Amelia wept confidentially on
the housekeeper s shoulder “and relieved herself a good
deal ”

            Chuckles often emanate from the British employment
of a term in a sense at variance with American
usage   There is that oft quoted example  near the
opening of Trial by Jury   where Defendant asks  “Is
this the Court of the Exchequer?” and having been
assured that it was  Defendant  aside  commands himself
to “Be firm  be firm  my pecker ”  The British  of
course  do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue 
since to them pecker means `courage   as in the phrase
“to keep your pecker up ”  Two of the more common
examples of British American divergence of usage are
screw and knock up    In Vanity Fair  Chapter 39   the
niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat
your American sophomore might fancy him to be
when he “screwed his tenants by letter ”  He was simply
making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees 
Similarly  when in Chapter XXXIV of the same
novel  Mrs  Bute reminds her husband that “You d have
been screwed in goal  Bute  if I had not kept your
money ” she was not speaking of pleasures deferred   In
Bleak House  Chapter XXVII  Grandfather
Smallweed  referring to Mr  George  warns Mr 
Tulkinghorn that “I have him periodically in a vice   I ll
twist him  sir   I ll screw him  sir ”  In Kipling s The
Light That Failed  Chapter XIII   Torpenhow urges
Dick to attend a party that night  “We shall be half
screwed before the morning ” is his dismal sales pitch
to Dick 

            In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair   Thackeray reports
on Joe Sedley s drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the
next morning  even if he had to “knock up the Archbishop
of Canterbury at Lambeth ” in order to have
him in readiness to perform the ceremony   In Great
Expectations  Chapter VI   we learn how “    Mr 
Whopsle  being knocked up  was in such a very bad
temper ”  And who could blame him?

            Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from
the pure minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable
parts of the human body   It does not take a
too wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a
lewd nature   Who can  for instance  blame a youth
with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing
when he reads in Pater s Marius The Epicurean  Chapter
V  a reference to Apuleius  The Golden Ass noting
that “all through the book  there is an unmistakably
real feeling for asses    ”?  In Scott s The Bride of
Lammermoor  Chapter VII   one reads about a boy
“cudgelling an ass ” and one goes back over the passage
to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical
error for “cuddling ”

            One may be indulged a giggle even though he is
sure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety
when she recorded in Out of Africa  Part V  Chapter
4  how “Fathima s big white cock came strutting up
before me ”  And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth 
in his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century
 Herder and Herder  N Y   1971  did not intend to hint
at closet biographical matter when  in Chapter I  he
wrote that “Whitman s poems are full of men doing
things together ” or  later in the same chapter  when he
referred to “Whitman s joyous workmen swinging their
tools in the open air ”  College freshman still read with
flendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spenser s The
Faerie Queene  and never mind the title!  that tells
how

            A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine 

            In his poem Mr Nixon  from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley   
Ezra Pound s Mr  Nixon advises kindly

            Don t kick against the pricks 

            although the identities of the latter are not divulged 

            One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous
proposal the narrator had made in Proust s Remembrance
of Things Past  Vol  2—Cities of the Plain
 translated by C  K  Scott Moncrieff—Modern Library 
N Y   1934  Page 90  to cause the Duchess to say 
“Apart from your balls  can t I be of any use to you?”
There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to
his friend  Edward Marsh  from somewhere near Fiji
 p  463 of A Treasury of the World s Great Letters  
Simon and Schuster  N Y   1940  in which he relates
how he sends his native boy up a palm tree  where he
“cuts off a couple of vast nuts    ”  macho victim not
disclosed    In the first chapter of Uncle Tom s Cabin  
Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr 
Shelby  part of which goes  “ `Well   said Haley  after
they had both silently picked their nuts for a season 
`what do you say?  ”  In Bleak House  Chapter XXIV 
Dickens may cause some readers to blush when he
wrote of Mr  George s blush that “He reddened a little
through his brown ”

            We must move ineluctably to a consideration of
perfectly reputable words which  having acquired sexual
connotations  cause adolescent—and often adult—
hilarity  even when read by a person of only mildly
prurient mind   In Forster s A Passage to India  Chapter
XXXI  a vivid picture is created by the sentence
“Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse ”
Pages later  Chapter XXXVII   it is acknowledged that
“He  too  felt that this was their last free intercourse ”
Apparently from then on  it was going to have to be
cash or credit card only   In The Bride of Lammermoor
 Chapter V   we are informed that the heroine “placed
certain restrictions on their intercourse ” a limitation
that might have been more usefully set in that same
author s Rob Roy  Chapter VII  where we are told of
the chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be
“thrown into very close and frequent intercourse ”

            A variation of this theme is found in Robert
Browning s The Flight of the Duchess  Section V  


—Not he!  For in Paris they told the elf
Our rough North land was the Land of Lays 
            

            even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is

            More picturesque are the references to erections 
An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India  Chapter
XXI  in which Forster describes a small building as “a
flimsy and frivolous erection ” while in The Mayor of
Casterbridge  Chapter XVI  the Mayor himself “beheld
the unattractive exterior of Farfrae s erection ”  A
phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader 

            Consider Dickens  sharp image in Bleak House  Chapter
LIV  when he describes how “Sir Leicester leans
back in his chair  and breathlessly ejaculates     ”
Or  in Nicholas Nickleby  Chapter XLVII   where that
admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur
Gride “again raised his hands  again chuckled 
and again ejaculated ”  And in his short tale  Lionizing  
Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction
of one of his characters  “ ` Admirable!   he ejaculated 
thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the
manoeuvre ”

            Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative
meanings over the years!  Earlier in this century 
pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete
male  thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelley s
noble image in Adonais  verse XXXIII  


His head was bound with pansies over blown 
            

            not to mention Poe s odd allusion in For Annie  


With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies 
            

            Or  more slap stickish  E F  Benson s action picture in
Lucia in London  Chapter 8   “Georgie stepped on a
beautiful pansy ”

            Of more recent vintage is gay    Nobody used to
snicker at Chaucer s line  No  5818  in The Prologe of
the Wyf of Bathe   in which that harried dame asks 


Why is my neghebores wif so gay?
            

            In his poem The Menagerie   one of William
Vaughan Moody s characters advises 


If nature made you so graceful  don t get gay 
            

            while in Othello  ah  the Bard again!   in his dialogue
with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women 
Iago refers to the kind that


Never lack d gold  and yet went never gay 

 Act II  Scene I  line 150 
            

            And what in the world is one to make of William
Butler Yeats s startling revelation in his poem Lapis
Lazuli  from Last Poems   that


They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay ?
            

            Indeed it is an amusing  albeit utterly wasteful
pastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples 
May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided
readers!  One caveat  never assume blithely that an odd
word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds 
In The Bride of Lammermoor  Chapter VI  Bucklaw
vows  “I will chop them off with my whinger ” and one
feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is
but a whinyard  which is merely a short sword

            LIGHT REFRACTIONS




            If you are a fan of old fashioned jazz—what is now
known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar
with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the
genre—a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble  
Even if you are not a fan  you must have heard it
as least a dozen times   It is the one that goes  “Dah!
Dah!  Dah!  Dah!  da dat dat dah!  Da de da de da de dat dat dah
!  da de da de da de dat dat dah!”


That s it  sure  you ve heard it 
            

            I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble
back in about 1940  when I was in my early teens 
My memory is rickety  but I am sure my first recording
was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE  and I think  though I
am less sure  that it was played by the late “Muggsy”
Spanier  who was  to my mind  one of the greatest of
jazz trumpeters   Later  I got another recording of the
same tune  this one by  I think  Mezz Mezzrow   The
label said  MUSKAT RAMBLE   I thought that was surely
the first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical
error in  of all things  a simple title on a
simple 78 rpm record    This  remember  was in my
youth  and it was a time when typographical errors
were called typographical errors  not typos—at least
by kids in junior high    Some time later  I got still
another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE  with still another
version of the title   This time  it was MUSCAT RAMBLE 
That  I thought  was really absurd   Not only had they
left out the “R”  they d changed the “K” to “C”   Now  it
made no sense at all   On the other hand  I reasoned  if
there were  in fact  some sort of cat called a muscat 
perhaps it wasn t so outrageous   I looked up muscat in
my Webster s and found that it is a `variety of grape  
To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to
me preposterous   I was young and  by today s standards 
at least  pathetically innocent 

            During my time in senior high  and  after that  in
the Army Air Force  I had other things on my mind
 there was a war on  after all   and I didn t give
the MUSKRAT MUSKAT MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any
thought 

            Speaking of my time in the AAF  which was utterly
undistinguished  I think I must make a confession 
Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a
theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour 
Indiana   It was winter and bitterly cold   The wind
used to sweep across that damned airfield with what
seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our
bodies   One day when the wind chill factor was nearing
absolute zero  I took shelter in the service club 
There was the omnipresent phonograph  or Vic   short
for Victrola  and the stack of records next to it   In
those days  people as a rule did not take much care of
phonograph records   Usually the records were taken
from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks  where
they picked up dust  scratched one another  and
traded static electricity   I was shuffling through a stack
of about fifty records  and I came across three Bessie
Smiths   I played all three  and the few other G I s in
the room  which was quite large—big enough for a
fair sized dance with a small orchestra—either paid
no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn
Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead   Among
Bessie s numbers were Dying Gambler s Blues  Sing
Sing Prison Blues   and one I had never heard called
Black Mountain Blues   which has the imcomparable
lines 


Home in Black Mountain a chile  will smack yo 
face 

Home in Black Mountain a chile  will smack yo 
face 

Babies cry for liquor an  all the birds sing bass 
            

            and


Goin  back to Black Mountain  me an  my razor
an  my gun 

Goin  back to Black Mountain  me an  my razor
an my gun 

Goin  cut him if he stan  still  goin  shoot him if he
run 
            

            I was  and still am  captivated by “Babies cry for
liquor an  the birds sing bass ” and in the arrogance of
my youth  I was certain that nobody else on the airfield
either knew or cared who Bessie Smith was  nor
would any other G I  be enchanted by basso birds  so I
turned thief   I can t remember how I did it  but somehow
I smuggled those records back to my barracks and
got them home intact on my next furlough   I kept
them in good shape until my last 78 rpm turntable
died 

            End of digression and back to MUSKRAT KAT CAT 
Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward “Kid” Ory and
Ray Gilbert   “Kid” Ory played great jazz trombone 
The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him
listed as co author of Muskrat Ramble  

            About thirty years ago  when I was concocting an
epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand  I
went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel
that was being sold for an absurdly low price and
that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce   It
wasn t bad  The wine jogged my thoughts back to
Muscat Ramble    Muscatel is made from muscat
grapes  is sometimes called muscat   and  being relatively
cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content  is
the booze of choice for a great many wines   An old
college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth
birthday—meaning twenty years of AA sobriety—a
couple of years ago  tells me that when he was on the
skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk
tank  the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle
and Napa Valley smoke  

            I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was
almost certainly the original name of the tune   My
reasoning is that it is not likely that “Kid” Ory or Ray
Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat  and it s even less
likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat
doing anything that we would be likely to think of as
rambling   Muskrats  according to my encyclopedia 
look like giant rats  are found in and around the
mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds  have
partially webbed feet  and do a good deal of swimming 
They do not appear to do much rambling   Muscat 
or muscatel  on the other hand  is found on skid
rows all over the land   A guy with a bottle shaped
brown paper bag  damp and wrinkled at its upper
end  has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet
wine of high proof  and the odds are pretty good you
would find it is a muscadoodle    After the guy finishes
his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off  he is looking
for the means to get another muscat fix   Now he is on a
ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his
roadmapped eyes   I suspect that that is precisely the
song s origin 

            My theory is that the “r” got put in there simply
because muskrat is a more common word than muscat  
It is the same reason most of us  I assume  have heard 
“He s in the hospital with prostrate trouble ”  Prostrate
is a more common word that prostate   so prostrate is
what we get   The “r” fits in naturally   I got a strange
sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy
McHargue  who is now pushing eighty seven years and
has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with
some of the best jazzbands—Benny Goodman  Red
Nichols  Ted Weems  and a slew of others   Rosy  too 
had seen the tune as Muskrat  Muskat   and Muscat    I
asked him what he thought the original title was   He
had known “Kid” Ory well  and he said  “You know 
Tom  I m not exactly sure   I once asked Ory about it
and he said  `It s m u s c a t   Muskrat     So I think that s
just the way everyone said muscat  ”

            There you are   I find a muskrat ramble difficult to
imagine visually   I picture muskrats wallowing about
in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water 
but I wouldn t call that rambling   On the other hand 
a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain
his muscat level—now that has a touch of poetry 
Maybe not in the same class with “all the birds sing
bass ” but poetry  nevertheless 
         
         

            As a nonexpert  although interested  subscriber to
VERBATIM  it is “a bit mysterious” to me that the singular
noun absence takes the plural verb are    I refer to
the first sentence of your article about the Longman
Dictionary  XV 1  



         
         

            Helen W  Power  in “Women on Language 
Women in Language ”  XV 2  may bewail the insensitivity
of the male   But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity
when she describes a flight attendant as “the
person who passes peanuts on an airplane ”  I hope
Ms  Miss Mrs  Power never needs to draw on the considerable
first aid and emergency training that every
attendant must master

            Leonard Bloomfield  having begun with a theory
of meaning which emphasized the environment in
which objects were present and named  had to add the
obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is
not present   I have lately been reading accounts of the
exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of
Australia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of
the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency
of particular items in discourse   In the desert
the missing necessity is water   As the explorer Ernest
Giles put it  the explorer s experience is a “baptism
worse than that of fire—the baptism of no water ”

            My impression was that in the journals of desert
explorers the word water   alone or in compounds  and
words relating to water  were unusually frequent   It is 
I suppose  likely that people with little money must
think of money more than the well off do and that the
hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty
on drink   Here was a chance to quantify such things   I
decided to make a count of words relating to water in
reports of desert exploration 

            Taking quite at random a single page  page 7  in
the journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early
 1846  exploration of country east and north of Perth  I
find the word water used fifteen times   Ten pages on
 page 17   water occurs nine times but there are also
the related words stream  twice   well  twice   pool 
channel   and the circumlocution “essential element ”
Two words  dew and shower   refer in the context to the
presence of water  the rest are in contexts indicating its
absence 

            I tried another explorer  Ernest Giles   Taking
page 17 again  I was reminded that Giles is rather
given to semi serious poetic diction at times  and we
find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke
River as “the stream purling over its stony floor” or 
quoting some bygone poet  “brightly the brook through
the green leaflets  giddy with joyousness  dances
along ”  Perhaps present water called for some stylistic
celebration   Two hundred pages further on there is less
exuberance in the circumlocution “that fluid so terribly
scarce in the region ” and in three other references
water is simply water    Giles is not always waxing poetic
and may  like other explorers  be useful as a source
for the history of Australian and general English   His
use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed out reservoir
 “Gibson dug a small tank and the water soon
cleared”  antedates the OED   for instance 

            Since this linguistic statistical study of an obsession
might well prove to be an important contribution
to psycholinguistics  I decided to make a larger sample
of watery words  choosing the straightforward journals
of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton  who led an expedition
across the western interior of Australia in
1873 4   In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages
 151 60 of the published journal  there were twenty eight
occurrences of the word water  eight of them in
compounds   no page being without at least one example 
In addition  there was a rich collection of words
relating to water  not necessarily indicating its presence 
“Hoping to find a lake” is included  though of
course it doesn t indicate the presence of water   Even
words which are usually of more general reference are
brought into relation with water in a text like this 
Gum trees or rocks  in areas of sand  appear as signs of
possible water   Apart from these words and lake  
words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of
water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include
pool  springs  drainage hole  clay hole  flood  channel 
water courses  water hole  rock hole  drink  drinkable 
running water  stream   and native well  

            The last two items merit comment   Stream is often
said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical
ways  normally being replaced by creek  
Warburton s use  “sandbanks intercept the stream 
which finally splits into narow water courses and
spreads itself over the plains  and so it ends as a creek”
suggests a somewhat more complex relation between
the two words   British born explorers did not set out to
write Australian English  of course   Gregory uses
stream in the way normal in England  Giles consistently
refers to gens in the hills of central Australia 
though glen is not current  outside place names  in
contemporary Australian English 

            The other name  native well is  as a later explorer
David Carnegie  author of Spinifex and Sand  1898  
points out  a misnomer   He believes native wells are
essentially rock holes  depressions in rock  buried in
fairly shallow sand  which  when hollowed out by the
natives  appear to be wells   This sort of misnomer
leads Carnegie to suppose that “to the uninitiated no
map is so misleading as that of West Australia where
lakes are salt bogs without surface water  springs seldom
run  and native `wells  are merely tiny holes in the
rock  yielding from 0 to 200 gallons ”

            Carnegie also describes namma holes and soaks as
sources of water   Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the
base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir 
Namma holes have been variously described  to Carnegie
they are depressions on the surface of rocks  often
with a rounded bottom  where stones are often found 
suggesting that the stones have something to do with
the formation of the holes 

            Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss
in our speech of English country words  the glens and
streams  alive  anyway  in the journals of explorers  
coppices and brooks  woods  becks   and rivulets    Perhaps
these words did not really fit   We might have
done better with Arabic speaking settlers   Wadi   for
instance  would describe an inland creek rather well 
Be that as it may  a later Australian visitor to English
drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the
parched and thirsty but water obsessed vocabulary developed
in the drier areas of our sunburnt land 
         
         
            Favorite Grammatical Game  Puzzling Pronouns




            Here is a game just made to while away the hours
on a commuter train with your favorite author 
a perfect place to hunt for Puzzling Pronouns  

            
               Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer
can go wrong   There is really no excuse  Fowler says
 not he says!   but here we give examples of his third
case only  where “there should not be two parties justifying
even a momentary doubt about which the pronoun
represents ”  And here the deluge of printed matter
abounds with such specimens that one would
suppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions 
It is a game that is like fishing in a barrel  but more
stimulating mentally   I am not picking on the following
authors  it is just a random catch 

            In Thomas Hardy s The Hand of Ethelberta   it is
suggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to
see Milton s tomb in Cripplegate church   Her suitor 
Neigh  who had proposed marriage in a previous
chapter  appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta s
suggestion   This apprehension is observed by a
Mr  Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication
that Neigh has been dragged into going to the church
against his will “by his over hasty wife ”  One wonders
whether the marriage had secretly taken place between
the consecutive chapters!  You see  it is
Belmaine s wife who was doing the dragging

Naturally it was Lancelot who rescued her   Sir Boss

nick of time to fight Sir Mador for the queen   Nobody
who knew him would have expected him to
do anything else  whether he had been sent away in
disgrace or not—but  as it was thought he had left
the country  his return did have a dramatic quality

            The Joys and Oys of Yiddish



            Rabbi Robert Schenkerman
            Temple Beth Jacob
            When Isaac Bashevis Singer was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978  he remarked
in his acceptance speech 


The high honor bestowed upon me is also a recognition
of the Yiddish language—a language of exile 
without a land  without frontiers  not supported
by any government  a language which
possesses no words for weapons  ammunition  military
exercises  war tactics 

There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude
for every day of life  every crumb of success 
each encounter of love   In a figurative way  Yiddish
is the wise and humble language of us all  the idiom
of a frightened and hopeful humanity 
            

            The word Yiddish derives from the German
judisch `Jewish    The principal parent of Yiddish is
High German  the form of German encountered by
Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh
century   Yiddish is written in the characters of the
Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys
borrowing words from Russian  Polish  English  and
all the other languages and countries along the routes
that Jews have traveled during the past thousand years 
Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped  “I speak
ten languages—all of them Yiddish ”

            Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out
for hundreds of years  the language is spoken today by
millions of people throughout the world—Russia  Poland 
Rumania  France  England  Israel  Africa 
Latin America  New Zealand  Australia  Canada  and
the United States  where  like the bagel  it was leavened
on both coasts  in New York and Hollywood   It is
spoken even in Transylvania  A beautiful girl awakens
in bed to find a vampire at her side   Quickly she holds
up a cross  “Zie gernisht helfen ” smiles the vampire 
Translation  “It won t do you any good ”

            Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish
 Yinglish  without fully realizing it   Webster s Third
New International Dictionary lists about 500 Yiddish
words that have become part of our everyday conversations 
including 


cockamamy  or cockamamie  `mixed up  ridiculous  

fin slang for `five dollar bill   from finf  the Yiddish
word for `five  

gun moll a double clipping of gonif s Molly  Yiddish
for `thief s girl  

kibitzer `one who comments  often in the form of
unwanted advice  during a game  often cards  

mavin `expert  

mazuma `money  

mish mosh `mess  

schlep to `drag or haul  

schlock `shoddy  cheaply produced merchandise  

schmeer the `entire deal   the `whole package  

schnoz slang for `nose  

yenta `blabbermouth  gossip  woman of low
origins  
            

                and so on through the whole megillah   `long 
involved story  

            A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine
translation into English 


chutzpa `nerve  unmitigated gall   a quality we
admire within ourselves  but never in others   In
his delightful study  The Joys of Yiddish  McGraw Hill
1968   Leo Rosten offers two classic
definitions   “Chutzpa is that quality enshrined in
a man  who  having killed his mother and father 
throws himself on the mercy of the court because
he is an orphan   A chutzpanik may be defined as
the man who shouts `Help!  Help!   while beating
you up ”

mensch a `real authentic human being—a person  
naches the `glow of pleasure plus pride that only
a child can give to its parents   “This is my son 
the Doctor!”

oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary  as
Rosten observes  “can express any emotion  from
trivial delight to the blackest woe ”

oy vay  oy vay in mir literally  “Oh  pain ” but  in
its long or short form  can be used for anything
from condolence to lament 

On August 6  1945  the world s first nuclear
weapon was dropped on Hiroshima  Japan   Two
hundred and eighty two thousand human beings
died and tens of thousands more were left
burned  maimed  and homeless    Albert  Einstein 
whose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the
American effort that resulted in the atom bomb
and whose special theory of relativity formed its
theoretical basis  heard the news on the radio 
For a long time he could only find two Yiddish
words traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances 
“Oi vey ”

—The Little  Brown Book of Anecdotes

tsuris the gamut of painful emotions—some real 
some imagined  some self inflicted 
            

            Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those
poor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual 
and each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of
pathetic types  schmo  schmendrik  schnook  schmegegge 
schlep  schlub  schmuck  putz  klutz  kvetch  
and nudnik    Yiddish easily coins new names for new
personalities  a nudnik is a `pest   a phudnik is a `nudnik
with a Ph D    The rich nuances that suffuse this
roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a
schlemiel `clumsy jerk  and a schlimazel `habitual
loser   the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot
soup—all over the schlimazel    And the nebbish is the
one who has to clean it up  

            The Yiddish language  through its color  its target accurate
expressions  its raw idioms  and its sayings
exudes a refreshing magic and laughter  mixed with
sober thought  that has been handed down from generation
to generation and from nation to nation   Yiddish
never apologizes for what it is—the earthy  wise
soul of an expressive people learning that life is but a
mingled yarn  good and ill together 

            Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom  well rounded 
blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a

            The Women s History of the Word
            Those who are not familiar with feminist writings
may find it useful and interesting to consider a book 
recently published in Britain  that is typical of the
harsher brand of such works   The work in question
offers nothing regarding language  so its review here is
ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM   The feminist
movement is very much alive in Britain  and the
“Greenham Common Women” are probably largely
responsible for much of the national sentiment against
the Cruise missiles installed at an American base near
that village   In Britain  as elsewhere  most books by
feminist writers are reviewed by women  usually feminists 
Men are seldom assigned to review them  possibly
because the editor fears that they will be either
ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised  if not
biased against them  or because the editor is a woman 
Because writing an unfavorable review of a  bad  feminist
book would be tantamount to treachery  such
books are often unjustifiably praised  as was the case
with this work by Rosalind Miles  which was well received
on its publication in June 

            According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this
distinctly unpleasant book  Rosalind Miles is head of
the Centre for Women s Studies at Coventry Polytechnic 
a lecturer  broadcaster  journalist  and author of
several other books  including a “highly acclaimed”
biography of Ben Jonson   One might like to believe
that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship 
but the text does not bear out the promise 

            For the most part  the book consists of a rewriting
of history  from the dawn of time  with the purpose of
demonstrating two main themes  the “fact” that
women were responsible for all the important contributions
to the advancement of civilization  as the development
of agriculture  for instance   often despite
the arrogance and stupidity of men  and the “fact”
that women have long been subjected to domination
by men   Miles suggests that such domination is a recent
phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years
old—for she points to the clear superiority of women
in  primitive  religions and matriarchies  right on
through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers   At one point 
she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests
that females were responsible not only for all of
human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of
counting  in order to keep track of menstruation  and 
probably by the same token  astronomy   She quotes
 and  presumably  accepts  another source which holds
that “woman first awakened in humankind the capacity
to recognize abstracts ”  If you believe that balderdash 
you ll believe anything 

            In the good old days  we were taught that the
pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves 
Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves
but—what would one call them? — ordinary laborers 
Here comes Miles  authoritatively quoting Diodorus 
the Greek historian  who recorded  60 30BC  that “innocent
women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves
whose forced labour built the pyramids 


    bound in fetters  they work continually
without being allowed any rest by night or day 
They have not a rag to cover their nakedness  and
neither the weakness of age nor women s infirmities
are any plea to excuse them  but they are driven by
blows until they drop dead ”   p 49 
            

            As the pyramids were already about 2500 years old
when Diodorus wrote his World History   one is given
to wonder what his authority might have been for such
a vivid description   It is even less comprehensible how
a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery
to promulgate it   Miles s book is riddled with
many similar distortions  convenient omissions  and
generalizations 


    Women have always commanded over half
the sum total of human intelligence and creativity 
From the poet Sappho  who in the sixth century BC
was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively
and explore the range of female experience  to the
Chinese polymath Pan Chao  Ban Zhao   who
flourished around AD 100 as historian  poet  astronomer 
mathematician and educationalist  the range
is startling   In every field  women too numerous to
list were involved in developing knowledge and
contributing to the welfare of their societies as they
did so  the Roman Fabiola established a hospital
where she worked both as nurse and doctor  becoming
the first known woman surgeon before she
died in AD 399    p 52 
            

            Earlier  on page 49  we learnt about Agnodice  “who
lived to become the world s first known woman gynaecologist ”
in the fourth century BC   Clearly  this rosily
checkered past was soon to be replaced  chiefly  it
seems  as Judeo Christian Islamic Confucian Buddhist
cultures flourished   It was not too bad early on 
when  according to Miles  the seven Maccabean martyrs
who “saved Judaism” did so only at the instigation
of their mother   Miles continues 


In early Christianity likewise  women found not
merely a role  but an instrument of resistance to
male domination  in choosing to be a bride of
Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male
fry   Thousands of young women helped to build
the church of God with their body  blood and
bones when frenzied fathers  husbands or fiancés
preferred to see them die by fire  sword or the
fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout  sic 
the duty and destiny of womanhood    p 63 
            

            But the situation soon deteriorated 


Even St  Paul  later the unregenerate prophet of
female inferiority  was forced to acknowledge the
help he received from Lydia  the seller of purple
dyes in Philippi    ibid  
            

            This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array
of four letter invectives applied to males and by
adjectives like brilliant  unusual  inspiring   and so
forth to women   Citing a Judaic law book of the 16th
century which identified a woman for the days preceding 
during  and following her period as niddah
`impure   Miles has the lack of taste to write the following  


As a final stroke  in a grim foreshadowing of
what the future held in store for the Jews  the niddah
had to wear special clothing as a badge of her
separate and despised status    p 83 
            

            Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding 
Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with
the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell   Campbell 
known for his extensive analyses of the world s
mythologies  religions  and cultures  noted the marked
bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts 
later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine 
Most of the religions of the world connected woman
with mother earth  fertility  and all the other
progenetic and nurturing associations  and this was
borne out in the cultures of the people   According to
Campbell  the only godlike female figure in the Bible
is the Virgin Mary  and she appears  identified as virgin 
only in the Gospel according to Luke   As Luke was
a Greek  Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover
from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon 
Although this might help explain the Judeo Christian Muslim
tendencies to subjugate women 
treating them essentially as chattel  it does not account
for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures 
notably that of Japan   It is not entirely clear
whether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism 
Buddhism  etc  as they once existed  conceptually  for
it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment
of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering
to those religous precepts 

            Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and
religions are allegorical and that there was no real
distinction between gods and goddesses  who were
given sexual identity when in human form only to
make them more meaningful   With all respect  that
seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex
for this discussion  though we can certainly trace a
diminution in the role of female divinities  or divinity 
when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners
and progeny   Other debatable aspects are the questions
of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of
the theology or the ritual  whether the scripture of any
religion should be understood allegorically or literally 
and so forth   If there is something wrong  it behooves
us to get at the roots of the problem  not to flail about
wildly  for only after the source of a disease has been
identified can one properly investigate its cure 

            “History according to Rosalind Miles” blasts away
at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating
them will effect a cure of the disease   In this
jeremiad  males are viewed as the “enemy ” and are so
characterized throughout the book  which concludes
with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call
to arms  though not men s

            Archaeology & Language

             A VERBATIM Book Club Selection  

            Just when you thought it was safe to assume that
we now know all we are ever likely to know about the
past  someone digs another hole and unearths  literally
or figuratively  some ancient artifact  one day it is a
fragile scroll  found in a cave near the Dead Sea  that
turns out to be pre Biblical  the next day it is an entire
terracotta army of Chinese soldiers  the next it is a
skull  excavated from the Olduvai Gorge  that compels
anthropologists  once again  to revise their guesses
about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs
hominids   Most of the relies from the past are gone
forever  destroyed by the plows of countless generations
of farmers  reduced to rubble by erosion  by conquerors 
by prehistoric  and modern  urban developers  by
fire and flood  and just by time   Many  we may hope 
have not yet been found   The interest in man s forebears
did not become fashionable upon the publication 
a few years ago  of Roots   on a far larger scale 
we have been trying to discover all we can about the
origins not of men but of man   Strange to say  however 
that interest does not seem to be more than a few
hundred years old  if the ancient Greeks and Romans 
the Indians  the Chinese and other peoples were curious
about their own prehistory  I have not heard of it 
Perhaps the fascination with man s past grew out of
the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism  certainly 
modern archaeology seems to have followed
close behind  for the excavation of the supposed site of
Troy took place only about 100 years ago   Perhaps it is
just as well  for only by the means available to modern
science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts
that we find and  through radiocarbon dating 
determine their approximate age 

            Archaeology is a popular pursuit  and its manifest
results not only receive considerable publicity but can
be seen in museums   Not so paleolinguistics  or the
reconstruction of ancient languages   Even the remnants
we have from early languages that had a writing
system are relatively sparse  Classical Latin and
Greek  Hebrew  and a few other languages are better
documented than others  but for most all we have to go
on are a handful of tablets here  a few inscriptions
there  barely enough in many cases to allow us to
identify the language  let alone draw any conclusions
regarding its structure or meaning   Perhaps one day
we shall find an Etruscan library  buried deep in the
Italian countryside  but for the present  we have to
make do with what we have  which is precious little 
About languages that had no writing system  we know
nothing at all   But some very clever comparative linguists 
beginning in Germany in the 19th century  theorized
about how the nature of the ancestors of the
more modern tongues   In some instances  ancient languages
have been decoded  some from multilingual
inscriptions   The work of Jean Francois Champollion
 1790 1832  in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta
Stone was an astonishing accomplishment  for it
enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient
Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and
revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we
have today about their civilization  which lasted for
about 2600 years   Another significant break through
was that of Michael Ventris  1922 1956   who deciphered
the Linear B script found on Crete and identified
it as an early form of Greek   From the standpoint
of language  Ventris s work was more important  particularly
because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of
the early states of Indo European languages 

            Many years ago  a linguistic scholar counted all of
the languages then spoken of which he had evidence 
The total was approximately 2800  but that is probably
only a vague estimate  he undoubtedly missed
some  some have sprung up since his time  modern
Hebrew  for instance   and some have vanished   The
exact count is unimportant and  at best  spurious  for
it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for
what distinguishes dialect from language   Then  too 
one must examine the techniques used to group the
many languages of the world 

            Linguists examining Classical Greek  Latin  German 
English  Slavic  Swedish  Norwegian  Danish 
Dutch  Lithuanian  Iranian  Hindi  and the other languages
of India and Europe found that there were
correspondences among many of the common words 
Some  like French  Spanish  Italian  and Portuguese 
had more in common with one another than they did
with  say  German  English  Swedish  Danish  and
Dutch  which  in turn  bore only a remote resemblance
to Russian and Polish  on the one hand  and the
two extant varieties of  say  Gaelic  on the other   One
rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers
and toes  for after years of laboriously categorizing
these languages  the number of different main
branches  called families and subfamilies  came to
about ten   Ingeniously  certain differences between
families were explained by various phonetic shifts that
 inexplicably  took place in one language group but
not in another   Although certain other languages were
geographically nearby  it was impossible to establish
any resemblances between them  hence Basque  for
example  is not classified as being in the same family
with other European languages  nor are Hungarian
and Finnish  both of which belong to their own group 
At the conclusion of this vast exercise  done without
the aid of computers  there emerged a pattern of familial
relationships that linked together languages spoken 
in earlier times  from Britain as far east as Chinese
Turkestan and from India as far north as
Lappland   Charts showing the chief languages and
their derivations can be found in many dictionaries—inside
the front cover of The Random House Unabridged  
for example   Because linguists are constantly
learning more and more about the relationships
among languages  it is best to avoid using an older
chart  for the same reason  it would be wise not to
stake too much on the accuracy of even a current
chart 

            The languages discussed here are what are usually
called the Indo European family  similar family trees
could be drawn for the Semitic languages  Sino Tibetan 
Japanese  Bantu  Malayo Polynesian  and so on 
Each is a distinct phylum  although there may be
word borrowing among them  lexicon is considered
less important in the classification of languages than
structure and grammar   It is important  too  to note
that writing systems are irrelevant  for instance  Polish
is written  today  using the Roman alphabet  but Russian 
a related Slavic language  uses the Cyrillic  Yiddish 
a Germanic language  is written in Hebrew characters 
Latin  Greek  and Sanskrit  which resemble
one another rather closely in some respects  all use
different alphabets  and early examples  utterly unrecognizable
to untrained readers of modern languages 
were written in cuneiform  quite suitable for writing
on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus  and hieroglyphics 

            
It would be nice to think that while linguists were
working so hard to organize languages  they were
working alongside the archaeologists who were providing
the raw materials   But only rarely did they collaborate
and  with few exceptions  their work was not
correlated in a systematic way   Schliemann  who discovered
the site of Troy  used the evidence in Homer s
Iliad to determine his digging site  where any ruins
had long since disappeared from view   In many other
places  the ancient sites lay buried—and still
do—beneath modern cities  modern property owners
quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down
their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of
an ancient town will be found several yards below 
today  before a new building is erected in London  an
archaeological team examines the cleared site for its
archaeological significance   But there  as everywhere
else  nothing can interfere with progress and  regardless
of the finds and their importance  the archaeologist
must eventually yield to the bulldozer   Notwithstanding 
even the brief glimpses afforded by such
investigations can provide some insight into civilizations
that existed hundreds or  in some cases  thousands
of years earlier 

            Based on the sparse evidence available  linguists
theorized about the earlier languages that had given
rise to those attested   In other words  based on what
they knew about a group of languages which were
documented  they tried to imagine the language that
they sprang from   In most cases  they dealt with words
and functional elements  creating what are called reconstructions
in hypothetical family prototypes called 
variously  Proto Latin  Proto Greek  Proto Germanic 
Proto Indo Iranian  and so forth  the ultimate goal
being to posit a single language called Proto Indo European 
That is not entirely true  for linguists know
too much about language to suggest that there ever
was  literally  a single language from which all Indo European
languages descended   Nonetheless  it is convenient
to think about the existence of a group of
proto dialects which can be referred to as Proto Indo European 

            
It seems only natural that once an original language 
or Ursprache   was posited  the next step was to
speculate on its source  or Urheimat    That is what
Renfrew has tried to do   Essentially  he proposes that
the parent of all Indo European languages was itself
born in central Anatolia  whence it spread eastward 
westward  and northward  being modified by the influences
of the languages with which it came into contact 
till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable 
modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic 
Hellenic  Italic  Indo Iranian  Anatolian  Armenian 
Celtic  Tocharian  Albanian  and BaltoSlavic 

            I have no quarrel with Renfrew s theory—notwithstanding
the generally received wisdom that has
placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region
and the Volga steppes   It is difficult for the nonspecialist
reader  like me  to assess the validity of his arguments 
which are based on his contention that the
language  and its congeners  were carried along by the
spread of nomad pastoralism   Using the evidence available 
Renfrew contends that the original Indo European
language  closely related to Hittite  separated
after 6500 BC  with the IE languages of western Europe
developing from western Anatolia and those of
Iran  India  and Pakistan from the eastern division 
The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrew s
depends on whether one accepts a “wave” theory 
first promulgated more than a hundred years ago
by Johnanes Schmidt  a German linguist  or one of
indigenous development   Pottery finds can be interpreted
to support either the imposition of an elite culture
from Turkmenia or a late development of the
Indus civilization   Renfrew accepts the wave theory 
and in the last two thirds of Archaeology & Language
he sets forth his arguments in its favor   Unfortunately 
the presentation of his linguistic argument  where the
author is clearly treading on more speculative ground
than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology 
where he is on more familiar territory  is disorganized
and repetitious   It is difficult to place all the blame on
Renfrew  for his editor should have noticed the lack of
coherence   The result is an argument that is persuasive
but scarely convincing 

            Nevertheless  good books on archaeology assimilable
by laymen are not easy to find  and if the reader
can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned
about the precise birthplace of Indo European 
Archaelogy & Language provides an interesting march
through the millennia of prehistory in seven league
boots

            Webster s Electronic Thesaurus
            This software consists of two disks  one labeled
Installation and Program  the other Synonym Linguibase 
and a manual   The manual sets forth everything
with clarity  and the program is simple to install  requiring
only a few minutes   Only one thing made me a
little suspicious when cranking up the system  in the
descriptive text that appears on the screen  the word
labeled is spelt “labelled”—decidedly un American 
However  I went ahead  and  since I was typing the
text you are reading  returned to the beginning of the
paragraph to see how some of these words would fare 
I looked up the word preceding and was  after a brief
moment  asked to type in the word  which I did   The
screen bloomed forth with the following 

            Query  preceding

            1   adj being before especially in time or arrangement

            There were also some other parts of speech  one
definition for the preposition and three for the verb
 participial  senses   I called up the synonyms for the
adj and the following appeared 

            Synonyms 


antecedent  anterior  foregoing  former  past  precedent 
previous  prior
            

            The way the program works is this  one uses the cursor
to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are
desired   It is similar  in principle  to finding a synonym
in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms
to find them   I am not sure why  but I expected
the program to “network” in the same way   However 
when I highlighted antecedent   what appeared on the
screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent
missing  and preceding had reappeared   If all this
is too complicated to follow  let me summarize  you
look up word X and get synonyms A  B  C  D  E  F 
and G   You look up the synonyms for word A  and you
get synonyms X  B  C  D  E  F  and G   Even the
definition provided for the sub listings is identical in
wording to that of the word originally sought 

            This is very economical of space and involves a
clever computer ploy  but it does not provide a particularly
useful synonym dictionary  for  as we all know 
synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative
law of mathematics  in language  “Things equal to
the same thing are not  necessarily  equal to each
other ”  Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they
had got round that little problem by giving the same
definition for each of the items in the list  but we know
that only very rarely are two synonyms bi unique
 which is another way of saying that if A   B  B does
not necessarily always equal A   an ineluctable fact of
language 

            If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary
is likely to be of use  then this package may be of
service   It works with a hard disk or with a set of
floppies and can be used with 29 popular word processing
programs    That was the number listed when I
received my copy  it might have increased    It also has
a few neat features  like suggesting a few alternatives if
you happen to think that preceding is spelt “preceeding”
 as many people do    It has a useful “Help” feature
that can be called upon at any stage   Also  if you
enter jump   you get the synonyms for that  but if you
enter jumped   you get the  same  synonyms but inflected—including
the variants leapt  leaped for leap  
All in all  for a relatively primitive system  it is not too
bad  but you would have to be in love with your computer
to use it in preference to a far more complete
books of synonyms available  especially The Synonym
Finder   Rodale in the U S  and Canada  Longman
elsewhere  which offers more than 800 000 synonyms 
more than three times the number listed in any other
synonym book  

            The blurb on this book disk package reads  “Supplies
you with 470 000 true synonyms for 40 000 entries ”
My guess is that such a quantity might be
reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations 
in reality  though  there are probably far
fewer actual words   Readers can judge for themselves
the validity of this numerical legerdemain

            Family Words
            In 1962  American Speech published “Family
Words in English ” by Allen Walker Read  which was
reprinted in VERBATIM Vol  I  No  4   1975    The article
is a classic  probably the first on the subject to appear
in a scholarly journal  though there are other informal
references to family language  some of which are documented
by Dickson in his Bibliography 

            Family words and expressions crop up everywhere 
Some are quite unique and their reporters cannot
imagine their origin  others  like Penn Station  
“what one family terms a child s misinterpretation of a
famous line or phrase ” are clear  the generic term
comes from the Lord s Prayer—“And lead us not into
Penn Station ”  Obviously  that works only for kids familiar
with New York City   Other Penn Stations  


Our Father  which art in heaven  Harold be Thy

Land where the Pilgrims pried 

Bells on cocktails ring

            Many people know F H B  for `family hold back   an
exhortation ensuring ample provender for guests 

            This is not to suggest that Dickson s book is a
catalogue of bloopers  or what Amsel Greene  and
Jack Smith  like to call pullet surprises    There are
many interesting entries in Family Words which  as far
as I know  is the first documentation of the genre 
There are occasional hidden entries  as the list of diseases—among
them the dread mohogus —under the
entry for Fowlenzia     In the VERBATIM family  some
suffer from Fowler s pip   an affliction affecting language
fanatics who base a slavish purism on a literal
interpretation of Modern English Usage   

            
               Family Words is useful and fun   Inevitably  some
of the entries are more imaginative than others  Dickson

            A Midwesterner  Will Hays  Jr   who is proud of
his knowledge of post Civil War history  tells me the
following origin of shot   as in shotglass   absent from
“Gunning for the English Language” 

            Although we associate trench warfare with World
War I  trenches were characteristic also of the Civil
War   A scaffold was built so that a rifleman—
who fired a single shot  muzzle loading shoulder
weapon—could step up and shoot over the top of the
trench   The soldier in charge would command  after
each firing  that the rank on the scaffold step down
and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded 
thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire 

            That war  like others  produced disgruntled veterans
and those more adventurous or more restless after
military service   They moved westward to start a new
life   The population increased markedly  with corresponding
demands for goods and services  among them
the need for saloons   Most new saloons were small and
the bars short  accommodating with difficulty the
many bunched up  in ranks  if you will  calling for
whiskey   Many of the thirsty crowd were veterans  as
were many of the bartenders   Thus  “Step down  or
back  and give me a shot” was readily understood   I ve
not been able to corroborate this explanation  but I ll
never forget it

think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of Calvinist
disapproval in this curt disclaimer 




         
         

            Although I greatly enjoyed Richard Lederer s article 
I fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass
monkey balls 

            The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to
fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns   The
word might also have been used for a receptacle near
the guns where powder and balls were kept   However 
this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden
box or something similar   The idea of a metal stand
carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced
as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion
of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a
heavy sea 

            So what is the explanation of the phrase cold
enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey ?  Well 
the obvious one  I believe   Anybody who asks “Why a
brass monkey?” is probably not aware that brass monkeys
were very common household ornaments in England
in the 19th and early 20th centuries   Originally 
they were probably imported from India  but were
later mass produced in places such as Birmingham to
grace Victorian and Edwardian mantelshelves   They
can still be found today in so called “gift shops ”  Usually 
they come in sets of three  one with its hands over
its eyes  one over its ears  and one over its mouth  they
were said to represent “See no evil  Hear no evil  Speak
no evil ”  There were various whimsical variants 




         
         

            I am sure I am not the first to point out Joseph
Hynes s  “Do Mistake—Learn Better ”  XV 1  mistakes
in Japanizing English words  e g   sei fu not “safe o ”
nain not “nine o ”  The possibilities for representing
English with a language of only forty seven syllables
are not that numerous  and the rules are very consistent 
The main problems are representing consonant
clusters and word final consonants   These difficulties
produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English
`strike —one syllable in English  five in Japanese 

            Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes 
Mine are the ones that are possible  but wrong 
English   Adding the Japanese final vowels produces
Gone with the Windo    Hypercorrection  where Japanese
speakers learn that many final vowels do not exist
in the American version of the tongue and so remove
them  sometimes incorrectly  gives us the California
cities of San Francisk and Sacrament    This process
resulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee  

            My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes 
however  does not come from the problem of sound 
Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation
or permission—in English  “to make someone or
to let someone do something ”  One day during a university
English class  a very discomfited student  after
frantic and obtrusive dictionary work  handed a colleague
of mine a scrap of paper   On it was written this
sentence  “Please make me go to the bathroom ”




         
         
            You Could Look It Up
            As everyone in the world must know by now  William
Safire writes a column in The New York Times
Magazine called “On Language ”  Considering the circulation
of The New York Times on Sundays  his column
is probably the most widely read commentary on
contemporary English in the world  that places more
than one uncommon burden on a writer  he must do
his utmost to be accurate  he must try to select subjects
likely to be of interest to his readers  and he must
write well 

            Those familiar with Safire s editorial style  reflected
in his political columns on the editorial pages
of The N  Y  Times   may agree with me in the contention
that when he writes about language he seems to
be writing on his day off  I cannot put my finger on
why  but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating
effort to be cute   In part  that is attributable
to the designation of his correspondents  who
keep him informed on language that is not within
earshot  as the “Lexicographic Irregulars ” an amusing
reference the first time or two it was used but now
beginning to cloy   More often than it might prove of
interest to me  personally  Safire deals with insiders 
language in Washington  where he is based  or with
trivialities uttered by some politico 

            As Andrew Norman wrote  in a letter published in
this book on page 113  “You flit freely back and forth
between prescriptivism and descriptivism ”  But are not
many of us guilty of that?  We are descriptive of the
usages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive
would be more descriptive—of those we do not
like   At least Safire expresses an opinion  whether the
reader agrees with him is another matter  as are the
questions of his accuracy  which arise fairly often  and
that of the suitability of his style  which  as far as I
know  has not been broached before   It ill behooves
me  excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap
larf ” to criticize Safire s arch puns  which permeate—“enliven”
is probably the word his editor would
use—his articles  but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable
for reading  however they might evoke a
chuckle when uttered viva voce    A handful of examples 
from the book at hand 


Therefore  I stand uncorrected   p  112 

   “Get your hand off my knee ”   That s a mnemonic 
pronounced knee MONIC  

Ize Right?   title  p  114 

Juggernaughty but Nice  title  p  115 

   slanguist    p  116

Logue Rolling  title  p  123 

 on  logue vs   log   Some people prefer their
logues sawed off    p  123 

But the Library of Congress wants to be non U  in
its spelling of  logue words     ibid  
            

            Writing containing such labored figures makes for
hard reading   I am interested in what Safire has to say
about language but find myself stymied  I get the feeling
that he has deliberately created a minefield of
interruptions in thought through which I must pick
my way to the end   Notwithstanding the valuable role
he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language
and in informing them about myriad facets of
the subject  I find it hard slogging  or  as he would
probably write  “sloguing”  

            
               You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection
of Safire s columns and  like the previous collections 
contains a selection of letters from readers   It is those
that are so sorely missed in his column   True  there is
an occasional mention in his column of a point raised
by a correspondent  and the Letters section of the
Magazine prints a comment from time to time  but an
important feature of the books is their inclusion of far
more writer reader interaction than one might suspect
from reading the column alone   For one thing  the
letter writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations
and are largely critical   Safire cannot be accused
of being copy proud  except  evidently  of awful puns 
as in “ Ms  is deliberately msterious   but at least it is
not deliberately msleading ” and other mscegenations  

            There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the
most influential writers on contemporary English  and
it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all
who are interested in the subject  regardless of their
alignment with his opinions   For one thing  he documents
many neologisms  an activity that endears him
to many working lexicographers   From the sometimes
cavalier manner in which he treats his subject  one
wonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility
he has toward his readers 

            The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from
which this review was prepared  unfortunately  there
was no proof of an index  but the publisher has assured
me that there will be one in the published book  a
rather essential ingredient of a work with this title

            Webster s New World Guide to Current American
Usage

            Here is a commonsense style book  useful to those
who have the education and common sense to be in
doubt about questions of English usage   It has some
problems  if you want to be sticky about things  on p 
xv we read 


   Einstein s Special Theory of Relativity does
not say that E   MC² and in leap year MC³ 
            

            Indeed it does not   But it does say E   mc²   the version
with the capital M and C is  essentially  meaningless
to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used
in physics 

            While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know
how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a
usage book  most reasonable writers have taken a stab
at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely
place to look  then have provided a detailed index   Not
Bernice Randall   True  one can find different from  
etc   in an entry so headed  but for absolute constructions
one is referred to an entry called “Covered with
onions  relish  and ketchup  I ate a hotdog at the ball park ”
If the user wants to find out about misplaced
adjectives and adverbs   reference is made to the entry
“Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design
on the handle ”  A search for only would be futile 

            Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need
some lightening up  but I am hard put to agree that
they are quite as frivolous and light headed as this
book would have us believe   Fun is fun  but those who
might rely on such a book are quite serious about the
information they are seeking  and it is unfair to play
fast and loose with their sincerity   A sense of humor
about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it 
but security is the one characteristic often lacking
among those who would use Current American Usage  

            There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work 
But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms?  And of
what use are the interminable examples  for instance 
of the misuse of like for as   which draw out the entry
to three pages?  More than four pages are devoted to
clichés  under the guise of “Lo and behold  it s man s
best friend  ” which  being an exclamation  really
ought to end in an exclamation point    The article on
British American English  “There s no home like Eaton
Place ”  is a good one  but  at six pages  its utility is
questionable   In the matter of pronunciations of
BrEng names  it is an old fashioned fantasy of Americans
that Brits go round saying POM frit for Pontefract  
most Brits that I have heard give the name a
spelling pronunciation these days  and so with many of
the old shibboleths   Of what relevance  to usage  notwithstanding
the fact that the topic is interesting  is an
entry on eponyms  “John Bull and John Hancock are
not just any johns ” ?  That is not  strictly speaking  a
subject pertinent to the title of the book 

            All of which is to say that the book is an interesting
work on the language and contains accurate 
though longwinded information about what it covers 
“interesting and useful facts about American English ”
Its only real faults are its title  which belies the content 
the cutesy headings  and the lack of a truly detailed
index  self indexing does not provide coverage of
sufficient detail   As a reference work on usage  it is far
from complete  The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department
could have used an entry on foreword 
forward  spelt “foreward” in the release accompanying
the review copy  

            A longish section  “Some Troublesome Idiomatic
Prepositions ” and a “Glossary of Grammatical and
Linguistic Terms Used in This Book ” followed by a list
of “References ” sources associated with specific entries 
round out the work

            Loose Cannons & Red Herrings

            Readers should be familiar with Robert Claiborne s
earlier books  especially Our Marvelous Native
Tongue  The Life and Times of the English Language  
One might say that subtitling the present book “A
Book of Lost Metaphors” is an example of a loose
canon  sic  — unless metaphor is taken in its broadest
sense—but one is unlikely to find red herrings here  the
etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are
given  many not readily findable in standard works of
reference   The rationale behind referring to them as
“lost” arises from the author s observation of an unfortunate
state of affairs  because of an increasingly widespread
lack of familiarity with the basic  structural
elements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology 
the Bible  literature  and ordinary historical
fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of
terms like aphrodisiac  Achilles  sic  heel or tendon 
meet one s Waterloo  sow dragon s teeth   and hand writing
on the wall   to name a few   There are many  of
course  but unaccountably  they are not the focus of
this book 

            Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions
like sow one s wild oats   about which he tells us little
or nothing  the modern Latinate designation Avena
fatua came too many centuries after the original expression
to have any relevance to it  so why bring up
the information that fatua is Latin for `foolish   it was
also Latin for `wild   which might be more to the
point   In any event  it is hard to discern  from the arch
style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting 
just what is the origin of sow one s wild oats    In
many entries  Claiborne labors the obvious  offering
little or nothing we do not already know  could easily
imagine  or for which the author offers no explanation 
Among examples of the first are spit and polish 
on the spot  on the square  stick one s neck out   etc 
Examples of the last include spill the beans  square the
circle  stalemate   etc   Between these is an occasional
flash of useful wisdom  much of it pretty well covered
by other books of this type  which seem to be proliferating  

            What is missing  for example  at square the circle  
is the information that because the area of a circle is
mathematically calculated using pi   which is irrational 
there is no mathematical way of calculating the
dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a
given circle   But that does not mean that such a square
cannot exist   As for stalemate   which is related to
checkmate   would it not have been important to indicate
that the   mate part has nothing to do with English 
having been borrowed from checkmate which is a
loanword from Persian  and has nothing to do with
check   either  

            Often  an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology
and merely explains the meaning   Does any
reader need an entry like this one?

            
               straddle    When you straddle a horse  you ve got
one leg on either side of the animal   When a
politican straddles an issue  he s in much the same
position 

            Some speculative suggestions  as the derivation  or
reinforcement  from Seidlitz powders for take a powder
are sheer nonsense   Not all entries contain misleading 
dull  or incorrect information  but those that do
not are marked by a lack of originality

            Word Maps

            Dialect geography  a branch of dialectology  describes
certain features of the dialects of a language
and their distribution   The field is about 100 years old 
Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in
England was Joseph Wright  who prepared the six volume
English Dialect Dictionary   which was published
between 1898 and 1905  the best known contemporary
British specialist is Harold Orton   In America 
work proceeded space during the 1930s  largely under
the direction of Raven McDavid  Hans Kurath  and 
later  Harold Allen  more recently  Lee Pedersen and
others have investigated American English dialects 
Between 1948 and 1961  fieldworkers based at the University
of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects 
which studied 313 localities in England  which 
as everyone ought to know  does not include Wales or
Scotland    The present book is extracted from the two
major works that resulted from the Survey  The Linguistic
Atlas of England  1978  and A Word Geography
of England  1974   both under the direction of Harold
Orton  aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter
effort 

            People generally seem to find dialect study interesting 
One letter writer to The Times  21 June 1988 
reported 


Our close neighbour    in Bere Regis  who was
born in the village and who speaks with a delicious
Dorset burr  always uses “I” instead of “me ”   

“Well  it makes company for I and company for
she ”  Another of his happy expressions is inner wards 
meaning `since   as in   “I chucked him
out the door and he s not been back innerwards ”
            

            Another reported  same date  


Let s get it right   The Bristol for “me” is not “I ”
but “oi ”  When I was teaching there  the explanation
invariably given by boys brought to me for
scrapping in the playground was  “Ee it oi  so oi
it ee ”
            

            The 100 maps selected for representation from the
Survey yield information on several hundred words 
some of which are clear variants  others quite different
lexical entities   For instance  Map 34 shows the areas 
marked off by boundary lines  where the variants
chimley chimbley  chimmock  chimdey  chimbey   and
chimney occur   Map 33 shows the distribution of child
 most of southern England  and of bairn  north of a
slightly wavy line between Boston  on the Wash to the
east  and Lancaster  on the west coast  

            The authors have provided a brief introduction
which is easy to follow  a list of suggested readings 
and the names and addresses of the several institutions
and societies in Britain where readers may indulge a
more intensive interest in dialect study   The maps are
clear  each occupying a full page  and the word information
is well set forth on them   Where necessary 
brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any
information that might seem to be out of the ordinary 
I have only one nit to pick with the authors   In their
description of isoglosses   they write 


These are drawn to run midway between 
localities which were shown by the Survey of
English Dialects to use the different words or
pronunciations which are the subject of the map 
            

            Although it is true that isoglosses  in effect  set off the
various areas where a particular usage was recorded 
more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites
either where speakers employ both usages or where
speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity 
Hence  the term isogloss   from iso   `same    gloss
`word   to describe the line on a map where the terms
are of equal distribution   Isoglosses are to dialect maps
what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps  what
isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans  etc 
The authors are not alone in getting this wrong  it is
incorrect in some dictionaries 

            In those countries where dialect study is undertaken 
dialectologists observe that there are today
many factors militating against the strict maintenance
of older dialect boundaries  the standardization of terminology
as adopted by national periodicals  news
services  radio  and television  the establishment of
“prestige” dialects and  through the media  their
promulgation  and the huge population shifts that
have taken place  particularly in the U S  since WWII 
Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England 
but seem now to be speeding up   There are many
other  lesser factors at work  but taken together  all
tend toward standardization  especially as the older
speakers die off   In some respects  it may not be long
before certain aspects of dialect geography will be
largely historical   The importance of dialect is emphasized
regularly in the press  where we read about people
being killed  as in parts of India  because they use
the wrong shibboleths 

            This book is a good introduction to the subject  in
England   those familiar with dialectology in
America  and those interested in the study in England
or  indeed  generally would be well advised to add
Word Maps to their libraries

            American Literary Almanac

            This is an interesting  useful reference book containing
information about the better known writers of
America   It is divided into eighteen chapters varying
in length  each dealing with a different aspect of the
authors and their works  among them

            These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography
and a detailed Index 

            As can be seen from the chapter headings  some of
the material is trivial  but nonetheless interesting for
that   It is not at once apparent why the book is styled
an “almanac ” but that is unimportant  there is no
other book I know of that contains as much diverse
information about American writers as this one   Its
readability and organization make it suitable for
browsing—even for reading straight through—so in
that respect  at least  it does not resemble books in the
“Oxford Companion” series   It contains many photographs
of writers  some quite early  these enliven the
appearance of the book but accomplish little else  unless
one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked
like at the age of 15  as a printer s devil  or in the
appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a
railroad track in Cleveland in 1916 

            It is difficult to make any sensible connection between
the lives of authors and their creations   A handful
might have led colorful existences  some are objects
of interest because they died early  committed suicide 
were related to  other  famous people  and so forth 
but such information seldom reveals as much about
their output as do the creations themselves  and in
certain cases one is probably better off not knowing
quite so much 

            This book appears to have been diligently researched
and has much to recommend it as an adjunct
to most libraries  public and private  large and small 
general and specialized

on Cuthbert  Dickens uses intercourse to mean `communication

when Scrooge says “I will not be the man I must have
been but for this intercourse” to the third Spirit 

            I would think that the words grand and stretch
would be known to more people than two of the words
the author gives as being familiar   chippy and hootch   

            Incidentally  I seem to recall reading somewhere
that skins as slang for `dollars  dates from frontier days
when trappers used animal skins as currency  and is
therefore much older than early 20th century Harlem

CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION
Dear Friend 
The enclosed set of name and address labels is a FREE GIFT to you from America’s
leader in protecting our increasingly vulnerable ocean planet    the Center for
Marine Conservation  I hope you enjoy using them as you correspond with your friends
and family and help us spread the word to protect ocean wildlife 
I hope  too  that they remind you just how much danger these beautiful marine species
and their ocean habitats are in right now!
Even today  after years of public outrage  dolphins continue to die in tuna fisheries
of other countries and are still being cruelly and often illegally killed by gillnets
and harpoons  And now  growing numbers of dolphins with malignant tumors and high
levels of toxic chemicals in their tissues are washing onto U S  beaches  The cause  
undetermined  but the suspected culprit is pollution poisoning our oceans with toxic
chemicals and sewage 
And thousands of endangered sea turtles and other creatures continue to die each year
unnecessarily due to wasteful fishing and over development  forces that keep these
species in a fragile state

      Dear Name 
      It s tough growing up today  We know that children do better when they
      have a network of caring adults to nurture and motivate them  When young
      people don t have that support  they need other resources for
      encouragement to guide them along the way  Big Sisters helps bridge that
      gap by providing children with the resources they need    Big Sisters
      volunteers 
      Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully
      reach their potential  experience life s opportunities and perhaps begin
      to dream  The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations
      from which healthy values and strong self confidence can grow  helping
      youth become strong  independent adults of tomorrow 
      This year we will serve over 1 000 girls through our mentoring
      programs  This is an impressive number  but for each girl served  more
      are left unserved  Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big
      Sister 
      You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and
      our $200 000 goal  If you are a regular contributor to the Annual
      Campaign  I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by 10%  If you
      have not supported Big Sisters in the past  please join me in doing so by
      completing and returning the enclosed pledge form 
      Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth  But caring
      adults like you can reach out and help  It s the perfect time to make a
      world of difference 
      Sincerely

      Dear Friend 
      This is not newsletter  It is a fund raising appeal 
      But there s no reason why we shouldn t share good news at the same
      time  Federal  state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing
      much needed funding sources for people who are truly in need  In spite of
      that  Pleasant Run Children s Homes  with the help of hundreds of
      volunteers and others who really care  continues to make a significant
      impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help 
      We all hear about today s increases in neglect  abuse and abandonment
      of those who can t fight back  children  Yet few of us hear enough about
      kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade 
      The positive side  These are special children  They come into a
      Pleasant Run program    whether it s for therapeutic help in their own
      homes  which nurtures whole families   through foster care families or in
      the familial surroundings of our residential homes 
      For some  it s a matter of weeks or months  for others  it s years 
      They leave Pleasant Run  generally  ready and able to contribute to
      society  We re proud of our children and all that they overcome 
      We are a not for profit  multi service agency  We wouldn t exist if
      the need weren t there  The numbers of children who deserve our services
      are rising    as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them 
      Please help us help them  Pleasant Run Children s Homes     where good
      kids get better

      Dear Friend 
      What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run
      Children s Homes?
      Little ones  like Baby Jessica  caught in the struggle between
      adoptive and birth parents  Older kids  like Tracy and Kerry  left
      homeless after a recent murder suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and
      Dad  Young adults  like Mary T   a jobless mother of three  trying
      desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime ridden
      neighborhood  Real people!
      There are thousands more  Families are being torn apart  and too
      often  children are the victims  Kids like Tommie J   made a ward of the
      court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father  Alice  sent to
      a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders  and John
      H   a recovering alcoholic  rebuilding a relationships with his family so
      they can live together again 
      Pleasant Run Children s Homes began serving children nearly 130 years
      ago  Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil
      War  Today  we serve children and families with a multitude of problems 
      emotional  physical  psychological and sexual abuse  Some come from
      families where  through therapy  there is hope for reunification  For
      others   families  are the counselors are housemates at the group homes
      where they live 
      The biggest tragedy is that the problems don t go away  they only
      grow  In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families  In 1995
      we will serve over 850 children and 340 families  In 1996  these figures
      will triple  The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given
      the opportunity to become happy  loving  and productive members of our
      society  They welcome the chance to belong  to become self  sufficient 
      to regain their self esteem and confidence  Often it is a long  hard
      struggle  but the results are well worth it 
      For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children
      and their families  we need your support  The Funding sources are
      shrinking  but the needs grow explosively  Please  help good kids get
      better  by sending us a contribution today  Your gift will give children
      and families hope for improved tomorrows 
      Sincerely

      Dear Name 
      In the summer of 1993  the Marion County Commission on Youth began
      what can best be described as a  new era  in its history  MCCOY was
      reorganized as an independent  not for profit agency  separate from local
      government  It retained  however  the same mission with which it had been
      charged from its inception  to serve as a catalyst for effective 
      coordinated  and collaborative service delivery to youth in our
      community 
      For the past three years  MCCOY has been actively engaged in
      accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others 
      youth service providers  youth  funding bodies  and interested citizens
      to name a few 
      We have met with a number of successes along the way  most notably the
      Summer Fun Line  the Metro Summer Bus Pass  and the development of ten
      neighborhood youth councils  A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition
      are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the
      years to come  The formation of The Community Academy  a pilot project
      directed at expelled students from local school systems  has come about
      as a result of MCCOY s efforts to mobilize community agencies in response
      to a pressing issue 
      McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community
      collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the
      inclusion of young people in both decision making and program planning
      processes  One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the
      United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of
      Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne 
      Indiana  As a team  these three organizations are working with
      neighborhood youth and adults to build a  Caring Neighborhood with Youth 
        mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a
      better neighborhood for all 
      Since its re organization  MCCOY has established its unique niche
      within the community by refraining from direct service programming and
      focusing on what it does best  helping to identify youth needs  convening
      groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs 
      and moving toward collaborative solutions  McCoy has only one interest 
      the well being of Marion County s young people 
      McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount
      of $10 000 00 to support such activities as 
           the co ordination of youth leadership training and youth
      empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of
      neighborhood based youth councils       the promotion of youth employment
      opportunities       the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding
      effective and efficient youth service delivery 
           the provision of technical assistance and guidance to
      neighborhoods which seek positive youth adult relationships 
           the development of community wide supports for the positive
      growth of all Marion County young people 
      In the last several years  the business and corporate community has
      recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to
      the development of a competent workforce  Youth who are supported and
      encouraged by both a family and a society that values
      
      Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and
      contributing members of adult society  While we have made significant
      inroads  there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do
      it alone  We seek the financial support of the Foundation to help us be
      successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people
      can grow and develop well  Your contribution will enable us to both
      continue and expand the good work we have begun in making Indianapolis a
      city famous for its commitment to youth and families 
      In our fund raising efforts to date  we have received the support of
      local government  foundations  and corporations as well as the personal
      financial commitments of individual MCCOY Board members  We believe there
      is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative
      effort to financially support the services MCCOY offers to the community
      as a whole 
      Thanking you in advance for your support  we remain

      Dear  
      Do you remember the combination of elation and apprehension you felt
      when you first left home? The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have
      those same feelings  Very few have family support to get them started 
      Many need furniture  linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on
      their own 
      To help them establish themselves in the community  the Pleasant Run
      Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to
      provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our
      programs 
      Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to
      $500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements  1 
      Release by the courts 2  Successful completion of all life skills tests
      3  Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program 4  Possession
      of a high school diploma or GED
      Proof of meeting these  two staff reference letters and an essay
      stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all
      reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel  which determines if the applicant
      merits the funds 
      Such fund are often used for college tuition  vocational training or a
      deposit on an apartment 
      Because Pleasant Run is the only  family  for so many  our
      Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first
      steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive
      adult 
      Without private donor support  this Fund doesn t exist  Please take a
      few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children
      successfully cross that threshold into the future 
      Sincerely 
      Mary Roth Executive Director

            Dear Ms  LastName
            
            These are the pawprints of a homeless animal  an abandoned animal  shivering with fear  with no place to call home  Where will these pawprints lead?
            With your help they can lead to Little Shelter’s good food  medical attention and a warm place to sleep for homeless and frightened animals  And then we’ll work to find loving homes for them
            
            You might be wondering how much to send  Our average gift is about $21  If you could give $20 or more  I can promise we’ll use your money to help animals start new  happier lives 
            At this wonderful time of the year  when people are celebrating 
             Over  please 
            
            “The only no kill shelter that’s there when you need us” Little Shelter is crowded with animals waiting for homes  It hurts us especially now to see a scrawny dog       a wet  starving kitten   homeless animals that would otherwise die if Little Shelter didn’t provide the care  treatment and love these animals need  If you could see them  I know you would want to help 
            Your reward will be the wag of a tail you’ll never see  the soft purr you’ll never hear    and the warm joy of knowing you were there to help when you were needed 
            Happy Holidays from all of us!

      The 1999 Invest in Youth Campaign is in full swing  As a former board
      member  the success of the YMCA is still important to me  We must be able
      to reach all youth and families interested in values based programs  The
      Invest in Youth campaign helps insure this 
      New initiatives in the inner city are taking hold  The Urban Mission
      Branch is reaching out to middle school youth with programs based on
      caring  honesty  respect and responsibility for themselves and others 
      For some  these are very different messages from the ones heard in the
      street  They are learning to make positive choices concerning alcohol 
      tobacco and other drugs and to support each other when those choices are
      challenged 
      You have shared in the vision and the leadership of the YMCA of
      Greater Indianapolis  I now invite you to continue to support the mission
      and the message that is so important to building strong kids  strong
      families and strong communities  Please consider joining the Chairman s
      Roundtable with a gift of $1 000  I have enclosed a pledge card for your
      convenience  We would like to announce the success of this year s
      campaign at the Annual Meeting on April 27  so please return you pledge

      Dear Friend 
      Adolescence  It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl when
      small changes in her behavior  or the choices she makes  can affect her
      future  It s hard enough for her to make good decisions when she s
      surrounded by support  It s even harder when she isn t 
      Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring  responsible adult
      volunteers with at risk girls  ages 8 14  A Big Sister is a mentor  a
      friend and a role model  helping a young girl to develop the
      self confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible 
      productive and successful adult  Your $1 000 contribution can put a
      mentor in a child s life and hope in a child s future 
      The results of an 18 month study completed by Public Private Ventures
      showed that children participating in one to one Big Sister and Big
      Brother matches for just one year  reduced first time drug use by 46% 
      lowered school absenteeism by 52%  cut aggressive behavior by 33% 
      enhanced school performance  and improved relations with family and
      friends 
      This is positive proof that Big Sisters one to one mentoring program
      helps change lives  Today  we are offering you the opportunity to help
      change a life  By contributing $1 000 you can support one match for one
      year  This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports
      the development of effective relationships  This includes a volunteer
      screening process  orientation  training and ongoing supervision and
      support by a professional staff 
      As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of  your match  and be
      identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office  in the
      agency newsletter and annual report 
      Today Big Sisters serves over 1 000 girls in central Indiana  But for
      each girl served  more are left unserved  Over 235 girls are currently
      waiting for a Big Sister  Imagine the difference the community could make
      if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match!
      I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to
      your congregation

      Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who
      have become dependent on it 
      Their complaint  the system discourages working because unemployment
      provides benefits that many entry level jobs don t include 
      That s where you   and Goodwill   come in  We help people train for
      and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare  Last
      year  Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs  more than double the number we
      placed in 1993 
      While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea 
      the people who need jobs are floundering  We need your support to
      continue getting people off of public assistance 
      Welfare is not the answer  And welfare reform is an uncertain solution
      with an unknown starting date  Goodwill works  Right now 
      Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today 
      Sincerely 
      Jack Dustman Chairman

      The goal of MCCOY  Inc  has been to make a difference  In 1998  MCCOY 
      Inc  led two efforts that  we believe  will help our community continue
      to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop
      well 
      Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified
      three goals for all our youth to obtain  economic self sufficiency 
      healthy family  social relationships  and involvement in the community  A
      short time later  the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young
      people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow
      up well  caring adults  safe places to go  and positive things to do 
      One group of adults and one group of youth  through two very different
      processes  have arrived at the same conclusion  our community still has
      much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into
      the responsible  productive adults who will our community in the
      future 
      As a provider of youth services  MCCOY  Inc  is here to support your
      valuable efforts to develop young people  Recently  through a lot of hard
      work and alliances with organizations like yours  some steps have been
      taken in our community that will help young people continue to be
      involved in positive activities  One  IndyGo in April adopted a
      much needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on
      their buses at half the normal fare all year long  Two  funding was made
      available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct
      positive youth programming on Saturday evenings  Through the youth
      mapping process  it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for
      youth on weekend evenings were lacking  That need is being met 
      As it has been an exciting year for all of us  MCCOY  Inc  cannot do
      its part without the support of organizations like yours  Annually  we
      ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort
      to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis  Enclosed is a donation
      card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of
      us to live  If you have any questions or concerns at any time  please do
      not hesitate to call me at 921 1288

      Dear Friends of Pleasant Run 
      The holiday season is the time of year when we re all busy buying
      gifts  baking goodies  decorating our homes and making arrangements to be
      with family and friends  This is the time of year when we give thanks for
      the warmth and love that surrounds us  And this time of year is an
      occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are 
      Pleasant Run cares for at risk children and families  We do this
      through a wide range of programs including community  based  therapeutic
      foster care  group homes and our treatment center  Many of the children
      are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes 
      Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a
      contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1 500 children families we care
      for  Many of the children have no homes  no memories of joy from past
      holidays  Others are from families that are struggling to provide a
      healthy  happy environment but don t have the resources to make it
      possible  Your contribution will make a difference in a child s life  It
      may help a family stay together  It can certainly make happy holiday
      memories 
      A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have
      presents to open  A gift means a family will have a holiday meal  cooking
      utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on  Your gift will go
      beyond the holiday season  It can help purchase clothing  school
      supplies  books and educational tools throughout the year 
      
      Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run  Let our
      families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of
      memories of the holidays you will have 
      We wish you and your family a new year full of joy and love 
      Sincerely 
      Mary Roth Executive Director

      Dear Name 
      What a Summer!
      And we re just getting started!
      I hope you ll consider continuing your support of Jameson s special
      campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx  I can tell you we need your
      help now as much as ever before 
      All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity  and 
      truth be told  with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed
      in  and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a
      spot should open  Many more camper referrals are coming from new
      organizations such as school social workers and family counseling
      agencies  It seems summer options aren t readily available for troubled
      kids whose families have limited incomes  so we re doing all we can to
      make Jameson available 
      That  we  includes the Youth Leadership teens  These 60 or so campers
      have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $16 000 for
      camperships  Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided
      they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing
      something real to help themselves  And that s from kids many people see
      as a problem 
      Even after the summer sessions come to a close  Jameson campers will
      take part in year round programs designed to keep that positive contact
      with peers and role models alive and important  We ve scheduled more than
      15 follow up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till
      next summers camping season 
      Please  consider renewing your support of these great kids today 
      Sincerely 
      Julie Marsh Executive Director
      P S  We know our follow up weekends are going to be better attended
      than ever this fall and winter  If you can give a little more to help
      meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support

      Dear Name 
      When Jerry was released from prison  he knew it would take hard work
      and determination to straighten out his life  He knew he had made a bad
      mistake  but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life  he just
      didn t count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path 
      Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up
      on the street  He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps
      until he could find a job and a place to live  The Trustee referred him
      to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill s Career Academy staff
      for job search assistance 
      Jerry s Goodwill caseworker found him a job immediately  But Jerry s
      troubles didn t end there  The seasonal construction job he obtained soon
      ended  and he returned to Career Academy for help once more  Unemployed 
      homeless and with a prison record  Jerry now faced going back to prison
      for failure to pay child support 
      It took some time and hard work  but with the help of Goodwill  Jerry
      was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor s office  find
      housing and conduct a more thorough job search 
      With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana 
      many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment  Of the
      more than 42 000 people Goodwill served in 1999  over 5 000 of them have
      multiple barriers to finding and keeping a job  Some  like Jerry  are
      ex offenders  Some are blind  deaf or have other physical disabilities 
      More than 100 were homeless 
      But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to
      overcome  like Jerry  With a promising new job at a plastic injection
      molding manufacturer  his legal troubles in check and a safe place to
      live  Jerry can get on with the business of building a life for himself
      and contributing to his community  For as long as he needs it  Goodwill
      will continue to help 
      Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement
      services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful
      employment  And  with your assistance  Goodwill can help employers
      develop resources to keep workers on the job 
      Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending
      a gift to Goodwill  Your generosity will help people help themselves 
      Sincerely 
      James M  McClelland President

      Your contribution to Goodwill will mean more than you may know 
      To help you see how much your contribution means  I m sharing with you
      The words of people who have lived Goodwill s mission  We want you to
      Know why your support of Goodwill is so important 
      Your gift to Goodwill is important because people with physical and
      Mental disabilities sometimes need an extra hand to know the pride that
      comes with work 
       I was sad when I couldn t go to the snack bar to buy a soda  Now I
      can buy a soda and spend money  I like working and making money  I have a
      savings account  I can write my name on the deposit slip  If I wasn t
      working here    I would be sad         Maureen
      Because turning welfare recipients into tax payers just makes
      sense 
       When I first came to Goodwill I was a single parent with little or no
      self esteem  I was on welfare and without my diploma  Coming to Goodwill
      was the first step toward my becoming totally independent  I am now
         totally off of welfare  I really like my job      Sherry
      Because people want to work 
       I d never finished high school  I had no experience or skills     The
      only thing I did know for sure was here s a chance to change things for
      me and my children    I rode a bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow  I
      wanted to be there    I had my second chance to change my life     
      Donna
      Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire
      life 
       Before I got to Goodwill  I was on a mission  I just wanted a job  It
      didn t matter what the job was  I just wanted one  Now  I m on a journey 
      I ve got more than a job  I ve got a career  My instructor played a role
      like no other instructor I ve ever had I appreciate everything that
      Goodwill has done for me      Cornell
      Each year  we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles 
      Their one common goal  they all want to work  A robust economy helps by
      providing job opportunities  but to be honest  most of the people who
      aren t working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest
      obstacles 
      The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like
      health care  transportation and child care  problems that are big enough
      on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental
      disabilities  illiteracy and lack of job skills 
      Last year  Goodwill helped 3 300 people find jobs that increased their
      self sufficiency  Your gift to Goodwill will be used directly to support
      services that will help even more find jobs 
      Right now  there are thousands of people who do not know what it feels
      like to support themselves  You can help them to know that feeling 
      Please help Goodwill and help people find jobs  Use the enclosed card
      and give a generous gift to Goodwill today!
      Sincerely 
      James M  McClelland President
    
  


  
  
    
      It s hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away 
      At Pleasant Run  Inc  we are making plans and arrangements for our
      children and families 
      Every year we seek companies  organizations and individuals to sponsor
      one or more of our families  These families are participants in our
      community based programs  These programs focus on keeping the family
      together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family 
      After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they
      often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils 
      beds  cleaning supplies  etc  We meet these needs immediately  But  the
      holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families  They
      do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a
      holiday meal 
      We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this
      holiday season  If you are interested and would like more information 
      please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693 9222  We would like to
      have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx  Thank you for
      considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for
      a family in need 
      Sincerely

            Dear Ms  LastName
            
            Over the past year  the Graduate School of Arts and Science has seen record level contributions from its alumni and alumnae to the School’s Annual Fund  This response is a marvelous endorsement of the work of our students  faculty  and staff 
            
            As you read the enclosed Dean  s Report and Request  I hope you will consider how your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund shapes the lives of its faculty and students as it makes an impact on the depth and breadth of their NYU experience  Contributions to the Annual Fund help us to prepare our master’s students with a thorough knowledge of their discipline  as well as the needed skills for success in the workplace  They enable us to provide students with access to state of the art technology and opportunities to attend professional colloquia  seminars  and conferences on and off campus 
            
            Your support of the Graduate School’s Annual Fund is critical to maintaining the core values of GSAS  rigorous inquiry  the lifelong discovery of ideas  and our commitment to the ethics of scholarship  We also hope you have been able to follow the public education campaign for our master’s programs in The New York Times and elsewhere  a sign of our belief in them  Your gift reinforces our emphasis on these ideals that have distinguished the Graduate School of Arts and Science as a preeminent center for advanced learning since 1886 
            
            I am grateful for your continued partnership in our pursuit of these shared values  With best wishes

            The Appalachian Mountain Club is looking for men  women  and children who share our love of the outdoors—and our commitment to preserving our region’s natural beauty for future generations 
            
            Please use your Temporary Membership Card to “Join the Club ” And join the fun while making a real difference for the environment!
            
            You name it—we’ve got it!
            
            Our roots are in hiking  And our roots go deep  When the AMC was founded  Grant was president and Bell was about to make his first phone call  Only 50 million people lived in a country where Colorado had just become its 39th state 
            
            Our members participate in virtually every Earth friendly outdoor activity you can name!
            
            From beginners to experts  they are into hiking  camping  and backpacking    cross country skiing and snowshoeing    rock climbing and mountaineering    canoeing  kayaking and bicycling    nature photography and birdwatching     and relaxing alongside nature 
            
            Our mission is great
            
            With our volunteers  we maintain 1 400 miles of trails  We provide overnight shelters  including the famous AMC Mountain Huts  to more than 80 000 hikers annually 
            
            We built our first hut more than 100 years ago in New Hampshire’s northern Presidential Range  and we helped protect the White Mountains so that they are still open to you now  Today our unique network of 10 huts and lodges—each a day’s hike apart—stretches 56 miles through the White Mountain National Forest  And we offer the same hospitality atop beautiful Mt  Greylock in the Berkshires 
            
            We’re partnering with agencies and other organizations to introduce inner city youth to the fun of the outdoors in Boston  Philadelphia  and New York City  We’re helping to develop

         ALASKA EMERGENCY
         Dear Defender 
         Look closely at this photo  and you’ll see a wolf     running  Soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow 
         This wolf will be running for its life!
         The airplane above will be tracking her     in order to land and immediately gun her down  
         
         You see  the Alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a $15 trapping or $25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down  This cruel  unethical wolf hunting practice is called “same day airborne land and shoot ”
         It was a total shock and surprise 
         In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same day airborne wolf killing  Frankly  we never thought Alaska’s anti wolf politicians would go this far  But they did  overriding Governor Tony Knowles’ veto — and ignoring the will of the majority of Alaska’s citizens 
         Unfortunately  this practice will begin after the first snow     this September     when wolves will be “can’t miss” targets against Alaska’s snowy terrain  Wolves can run fast — but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes 
         Given the urgency of the situation in Alaska  Defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save Alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot slaughter 
         Support the Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves 
         
         Defenders hopes to raise at least $100 000 to help Alaskans For Wildlife  a coalition of Alaska citizens  win a citizens’ ballot initiative this November  And we face very wealthy opponents  So today  I urge you to do these two things 
         FIRST  Sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same day airborne
         land and shoot” wolf killing in Alaska 
         SECOND  Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November 
         The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaska’s citizens and the American public at large 
         Like you  the majority of Alaskans oppose same day land and shoot wolf killing  But the anti wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want  And they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game  which opposed this legislation!
         They are utterly out of step with their Alaska constituents     the state agency that manages Alaska wildlife     and the rest of the American public!
         In the name of “wolf control ” wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion  so that the wolves have  literally  no chance of survival 
         And if history is any guide  over the years thousands of Alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed 
         Before the 1996 ban on same day land and shoot  as many as 400 wolves were killed in Alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice 
         Anti wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land and shoot law stands — even though most Alaskans do not support it 
         So if we don’t act right now  Alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in America’s “Last Frontier ”
         Say “NO” to the barbaric practice of same day airborne wolf killing 
         The only way Alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same day airborne land and shoot wolf killing is with a Citizens’ Referendum 
         That’s why your special financial support is so important — and urgently needed 
         Alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves 
         As I mentioned  this new same day airborne land and shoot practice will start in September after the opening of hunting season and the first snow — and when wolves will be an easy target 
         To repeal this unconscionable law  Defenders must help provide our friends in Alaska    Alaskans For Wildlife — with the resources necessary to win at the polls in November 
         Our well funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure  We need help to supplement the funds raised by Alaskans For Wildlife for careful polling  the development of voter education spots for television  radio and newspapers  the placement of those ads  and “get out the vote” efforts on election day 
         If Alaska’s new law is not replaced  thousands of Alaska s wolves will die in the years to come 
         And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection  A loss will encourage those anti wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild 
         So  please don’t wait another minute 
         Please sign your Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to demonstrate to our Alaska allies that you’re behind them  and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort 
         So how will your money be spent?
         Here’s the projected budget breakdown 
         $35 000 — in depth  state wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters’ positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters 
         $45 000 — salaries  office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day 
         $30 000 — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey 
         $100 000 — placement of voter education spots in the key media including print  radio and television  Money must be in hand by mid August to reserve time for September and October!
         $15 000 — election day “get out the vote” drive  including phone calls to get voters to the polls 
         You stood by Defenders when we defeated the wealthy American Farm Bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho 
         Now  I’m hoping I can count on your moral and financial support again today  to help save Alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot killing 
         Your special donation today is absolutely critical  because many of Alaska’s politicians clearly have anti wolf agendas  They have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of Alaska and the American public 
         Please let Alaskans know that you’re behind them  Let them know you share their concern about protecting Alaska’s wolves 
         Please help save Alaska’s wolves by doing these two things 
         1  SIGN the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show your support
         for repealing “same day airborne land and shoot” wolf killing in Alaska 
         2  RUSH a special donation to help our Alaska allies overturn this odious new law 
         Remember  for this emergency effort to succeed  we must act immediately 
         So  please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot  And then  mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaska’s wolves 
         Thank you for your strong support 
         Sincerely 
         Rodger Schlickeisen
         President
         P S  	Defenders needs your help to raise $100 000 in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition’s Emergency Effort to Save Alaska’s Wolves succeeds  So  please sign the
         enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to lend your moral support to our Alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation  Time is so short 
      
      
   


  
  
    
      November 15  1996
      Dear Personal Donor 
      In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job  Robert has
      learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes  His job
      objectives call for him to do it in 30 
      He has no time to waste 
      Neither do we  With the help of friends like you  Goodwill has
      continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing
      society 
      We don t waste time as we are helping the community  And we don t
      waste money  The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to
      continue our mission of helping people prepare for  find and keep
      jobs 
      In their December  1995 review of the nation s best charities  U S 
      News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five  Standout Good
      Guys   The magazine stated that Goodwill  as well as the other standouts 
      is  uniquely effective  innovative or valuable  
      While I appreciate U S  News & World Report s endorsement  the
      true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on
      problems that affect all of us 
      Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment
      barrier  the positive effects radiate throughout our community  The
      business community welcomes not only another worker  but a consumer with
      increased purchasing power  Parents act as role models of
      self sufficiency instead of dependency  Tax dollars that would have been
      spent on public assistance are saved 
      You and I know that solutions to difficult problems don t just happen 
      At Goodwill  it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our
      services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day 
      A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients   You
      can earn the money to support yourself and your family   she says   You
      can get off welfare  I know you can    I did  
      A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview
      to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing
      training program  once his tears have subsided  he confirms what his
      classmates have already figured out  he just received a job offer    his
      first in five years 
      Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center  a Goodwill staff member
      tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs  On his
      way home  he shares the story with four people at a street corner  At the
      next corner he tells five more 
      In order to develop job skills  a man with some serious disabilities
      begins working in Goodwill s industrial division  It takes a long time
      for him to gain the self confidence to work elsewhere in the community 
      Eventually  he turns your support into a payoff for all of us  He proudly
      leaves Goodwill to support himself 
      These people and their successes are real  Just like the respect we ve
      earned from U S  News & World Report  Just like the impact Goodwill s
      work has on our community 
      Real work  Real results  A real difference in people s lives    in all
      of our lives 
      The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no
      time to waste  Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of
      their success  Your support helps provide real solutions 
      Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously
      to Goodwill today 
      Sincerely 
      
      
      Jack Dustman Board Member and Former Chairman

         SANCTUARY
         FUND
         Your donation will help give an animal a safe home!
         Dear Ms  LastName
         I wanted to personally write you and give you our 2001 Collectible Calendar and talk about animals in danger   a cause we both care deeply about 
         Please take a moment to look over the enclosed 2001 Animal Sanctuary Calendar  Be sure to write me back to let me know your 2001 Calendar has arrived m good order  I’m sure you will want to keep it and prominently display it to enjoy these striking wildlife images 
         Don’t you agree that the lion and baby seal are looking right into your eyes? The mother elephant has a watchful eye on her young calf  And if you have ever experienced to sight of a diving dolphin  you will be brought instantly back to that exciting moment when turning to our August image 
         Can you imagine the lion on our calendar cover being cruelly killed for a hunter’s trophy?
         Can you imagine the baby seal crying out for fear as a sealer raises his club?
         Can you picture the baby elephant and mother with no place safe to rest and find water?
         Many of our critics say that you and I who love animals attribute intelligent and sensitive qualities to “stupid  non feeling” animals  But our ability to feel the fear and know the pain that animals experience is no “error in judgement” nor “overblown sentimentality”…it is real  It is humane 
         The International Fund for Animal Welfare is one of the largest  most effective animal welfare organizations in the world with a special mission to save animals’ lives  prevent cruelty  and protect natural habitat for wildlife to live and enjoy life in harmony with man 
         Too  too often  man has not been a good neighbor to animals  Whether we talk about clubbing baby seals to death for their beautiful pelts  or butchering elephants with hacksaws for their ivory  or trapping animals in steel jaw leghold traps where the pain is so excruciating they have been known to chew off a leg to escape  we stand guard for all animals 
         All animals need a place to “get to” in order to be safe from bullets  cruelty  traps and clubs 
         IFAW’ P O  Box I 93 Yarmouth Port  MA 02615 01 ‘www lfaw org
         IFAW is now launching our year 2001 Animal Sanctuary Fund to provide safe places for animals to live out of the danger tat comes from humans and loss of habitat  This is a new  special project that has been expanded into a permanent program 
         Whether it is to fund additional land for the Addo elephant park in South Africa where 29 calves were born this year or our partnership with Future Generations to save vital habitat for moon bears  bengal tigers and other animals  or our response to move orphaned lions to 500 acres of protected African bush where they will live safely for the rest of their lives… we are committed to the concept of ANIMAL SANCTUARIES 
         I’m positive you agree with this most basic  humane approach  I won’t even ask if you support this program  but rather  I must ask how much you can afford to support this Animal Sanctuary Fund today?
         I do not like to ask for money No one does  But money gives us the POWER TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VOICELESS 
         Will you please join with me today to help save animals from pain  suffering  hunger  hunting and abuse?
         Your gift will help give an animal a safe home 
         Be absolutely sure  your donations do save lives  For 31 years  our name has been associated throughout the world wit saving innocent animals  Many people know us as the Save the Seals people and we have saved thousands of animals   seals  elephants  cats  dogs  bears  whales  This new program will be a huge success with your help 
         I thought you would enjoy our 2001 Animal Sanctuary Calendar  It is a unique gift to you for taking your time to hear my vision of new safety for the world’s animals and my request for your hard earned money
         The simple fact is we cannot continue without your generous gifts  Gifts of $100  $25  and $15 all are important to keep our Animal Sanctuary Fund operating 
         Please rush me your generous gift of $100 or $15 today while these endangered animals are on your mind and in your heart 
         Animals don’t ask for much of us  All they need is safe homeland and freedom from pain and fear  Your donation today could save a life tomorrow
         For the animals 
         Fred ORegan
         President
         PS  Please enjoy the photographs of the animals you are so generously befriending  And please use the enclosed 2001 Calendar Reply when writing me back

      year round contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership
      teens  In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids
      and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on
      real projects  YL teens will make J C  juniors happen again this year for
      7 and 8 year old campers  A five day camp  J C  juniors introduces
      at risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously
      reach them  That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable 
      positive and important part of each child s life for an entire
      decade 
      The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for
      other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them  And their
      activities aren t isolated to Jameson  The teens have undertaken a
      volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local
      hospital 
      Please consider renewing your gift today  The kids need your
      leadership now more than ever  If you can increase your last donation  we
      would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts
      to overcome obstacles and create successful lives 
      Thank you again for helping point the way 
      Sincerely 
      Julie Marsh  Executive Director
      P S  You make it possible for us to help special kids with learning
      disabilities  behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the
      confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals  I
      hope you ll continue    and if possible increase   your support for these
      great kids

      Dear Mr  Ratcliff 
      CCI is a federation of 13 neighborhood based multi service centers
      whose mission is to identify and meet the human service needs of
      residents throughout Marion County in the most effective  efficient and
      comprehensive way possible  In 1998  we served a total of 31 484
      low income individuals through job training and placement assistance 
      youth and senior programming  family counseling  emergency assistance 
      and much more 
      As you can see from the enclosed map  your Target store is located in
      the heart of four of our service areas  The centers that serve these

      Southwest Multi Service Center  and Christamore House  have teamed up to
      run an exciting job readiness program for 14 and 15 year old area
      residents called the Summer Enrichment Program  Between June 21 and
      August 31  45 youth will spend 20 hours a week developing life management
      and work ethic skills  learning the computer  visiting area colleges  and
      interacting with guest speakers  The end result will be kids who have a
      better understanding of and vision for their own future  be it college or
      a career 
      The Summer Enrichment Program will conclude with a celebration that
      includes family and friends  We would like to offer our youth a small

            Dear Friend of Animals 
            
            I hope you’ll use the enclosed name labels  and colorful pet stickers  designed especially for friends of animals 
            
            Your name    and the name of The Humane Society of the United States  HSUS     are very important to the well being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives 
            
            I wish I could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals    dogs  cats  farm animals and wildlife  The sad truth is animal cruelty  abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community 
            
            Every day of the year  The Humane Society of the United States receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties  such as the horrors of the leghold trap  the use of dog and cat fur  needless or repetitive experiments on animals  and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats 
            
            Still others are less obvious but just as horrible  dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers  baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk fed” veal for the gourmet  and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen  And almost 6 000 000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America 
            
            What is even more shocking  is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel  painful deaths each year     needless deaths that could have been stopped!
            
            And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on  I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people  like you  to help us bring an end to animal suffering  abuse and neglect 
            
            Since 1954  our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties 
            
            We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local  state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty 
            
            Our primary goal  though  has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens  so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering  abuse and exploitation 
            
            But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty  we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources 
            It’s a difficult problem  because we have to fight the well financed and powerful agri business and research industries  but we do our best to protect the animals 
            
            Right now  the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty 
            
            And that’s where you can help  You can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe guarding the lives of ALL animals 
            
            Today  we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption  I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home  It’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal  too 
            
            I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax deductible donation today  Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15  will help The HSUS save millions of animals 
            
            I know you care deeply for the well being of all animals  Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated 
            
            Sincerely 
            
            
            President
            
            P S  We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect  But your help of $5 or $10 or even $15 is absolutely needed today  Please take this moment to be as generous as possible to send your best gift today  and don’t forget to use your free colorful pet stickers and name labels enclosed  Thanks in advance

         This morning  I closed my office door to interruptions  sat alone at my desk  and did something

         Dear Former Member 
         When we lose a member like you  it hurts    all of us 
         So this morning I sat down and thought about what it would take for you to give us a second chance  I thought about our 
         new  enhanced local efforts  our expanding scientific research and educational programs  our fresh new writing in AUDUBON magazine 
         Then I thought about an enticing way for you to regain your place among America’s most intelligent  concerned and caring citizens who proudly avow membership in the National Audubon Society 
         I’m inviting you back to full membership for just $17   51% off the regular rate

It’s people like you who make it possible to give the priceless gift of 
“Second Sight”   
Dear Friend 
Think what it would be like to live in a world of dark shapes and shadows where you
never know what to expect  to feel afraid to go places  to be hesitant about every
step you take  For too many  this is a daily reality — but today you can help make a
difference 
Having a guide dog allows a blind or visually impaired individual to experience the
possibilities of life  not the limitations 
It costs over $20 000 to breed  care for and train a guide dog like “Duke” and to
train his blind teammate  We use Labrador Retrievers  Golden Retrievers and a cross
between Labs and Goldens  Male and female dogs are used  And our dogs are specially
bred for temperament and physical soundness 
Every Foundation guide dog is given free of charge to someone who is blind or
visually impaired 
We are supported entirely by donations from generous individuals  corporations and
foundations  We receive no government funding 
The only way we can continue to provide guide dogs  at no cost  to someone who is
blind or visually impaired  is through your support 

Friends like you make it possible to give the gift of “Second Sight®”  I hope the
Foundation can count on your caring donation today  Many people send gifts of $35 
$50  or even $100 or more — whatever you are able to give to help
maintain this vital service 

And having a guide dog does make a real difference in the lives of our students  It’s
the special bond — of a loving and working 24 hour a day partnership 
“As a boy in Bosnia  I walked my dog  Now my guide dog  Franklin  walks me” says
Sead  He was blinded at 15 by a Serbian missile  “After I got my beautiful black Lab 
I finally felt like a human being again  Now I believe almost anything is possible 
Franklin has opened up a whole new world for me  A world I thought I would never have
again ”
As Pat explains  “Both my friends were zipping through crowds while I lagged behind 
even though I was a fast cane walker  I envied their freedom and most of all  the
incredible bond they both had with their guide dogs  With my Lab  Jay  I feel so
wonderfully FREE!”
Hank says he was a good cane traveler for 17 years — but felt his freedom was
curtailed particularly when traveling  “I had never had a pet  Having Aries just
makes life so much easier  For one thing  people are nicer to you  People love dogs 
They can relate to him and feel they have something to talk to you about ”
Our graduates  who are leading active lives assisted by the guide dogs given to them
by the Guide Dog Foundation  include  social workers  teachers  secretaries  policy
makers  college students  musicians  writers  homemakers    mothers and fathers 
As one of our donors in the New York area told us  “Sometimes you never see the good
work your money does  I see the results    the guide does I’ve helped sponsor
dramatically improve the lives of the men and women who receive them ”
Won’t you please take the time now to send your donation to give someone the
priceless gift of independence?
Sincerely 
Wells B  Jones

         Like your address labels  your gray wolf toy says good things about you and your love of wildlife!
         PLUS  there are additional membership benefits for you to enjoy  You’ll receive a membership card and attractive decal  wildlife and legislative alerts  in depth monthly information packets on wildlife topics  invitations to outdoor programs  exciting travel opportunities and regular receipt of our trademark wildlife stamps — a national tradition since 1936 — greeting cards  a calendar and address labels

      Dear  
      A few months ago you received a letter from me telling the success
      stories of people who got jobs with Goodwill s help 
      Here s another story of success from what might seem like an unlikely
      source  Goodwill s controller  Juli  She tells me that the 3 666 people
      we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars  In
      addition to that  by helping them find jobs  Goodwill reduced the state s
      Public Support tab by an estimated $4 million  Your gift to Goodwill will
      help us do even more this year because your gift will be used to directly
      support our work 
      What kind of work does Goodwill do?
      Goodwill finds jobs for people with mental and physical disabilities 
      After Maureen s job coach taught her how to do her job in a restaurant 
      we helped Maureen step out of the shadow sometimes cast over people with
      physical and mental disabilities and find a fulfilling job smack dab in
      the middle of society  Remember what she said in my last letter?  If I
      wasn t working here   I would be sad    
      Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance  Sherry learned
      through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the
      welfare system and support her family  At Goodwill she gained in
      self confidence  in her vision of her future and in the job skills she
      needed to find and keep a good job   Coming to Goodwill was the first
      step toward my becoming totally independent  I am now    totally off of
      welfare  
      Goodwill prepares people for life long employment  Cornell found a
      number of employment options that he never dreamed existed after a
      work site injury forced him out of his job at a foundry  He trained in
      desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with
      new found skills in a burgeoning industry   I ve got more than a job 
      I ve got a career  
      Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill  After a lifetime of trials  Donna
      not only earned her GED at Goodwill  she earned a job here   I rode a
      bike to Goodwill in the rain and snow  I wanted to be there   I had my
      second chance to change my life  
      Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their
      own stories of success  Your support will help them go to work 
      Please use the enclosed envelope to give a generous gift to Goodwill
      today!
      Sincerely 
      William A Carter  Chairman Goodwill Industries Foundation
      P S  Your gift is a wise investment in the community  For every dollar
      donated to Goodwill in 1998  we helped our  graduates  earn an estimated
      $102  That money was then spent in a variety of ways  adding fuel to our
      thriving economy

      Dear LTR_NAME 
      CCI has come a long way in the last five years  We ve worked hard to
      structrue the organization so that we ve ready to move boldly into the
      next century  and I believe that we have an exciting and successful
      future ahead of us 
      One of the areas we ve decided to focus on is development  It s clear
      that if we don t increase our base of private funding  we won t have the
      kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers
      and the very important services they offer  In 1998  CCI served 31 484
      individuals right in their own backyards  Where else would that many
      people turn if CCI weren t there to help?
      The community initiatives committee is working with our development
      office to put together a long range fundraising plan that will ultimately
      bring more money into our centers  This in turn will help us to increase
      and even improve the services we offer 
      With this in mind  I am asking each one of you to make a personal
      contribution of $50  $100 or even $1 000 to show that you believe in the
      work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and
      your finances  This way when we go out to ask for community support and
      are asked about our board giving level  we can show our in house
      commitment through 100% board participation  I also encourage you to seek
      additional support through your company  church  or service
      organization 
      I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with
      you to talk to these group if you need their help  We re at an exciting
      juncture and it won t be long until we start seeing solid results from
      our efforts  Your financial support of the development process is just
      one step in making CCI a stronger  more efficient and ultimately more
      effective federation of service providers  Please  make your contribution
      today

      Dear  
      Kids today face overwhelming pressures  everything from trouble at
      home to gangs and drugs  Youngsters often find themselves feeling
      alienated and alone 
      That s where the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis come in  We
      reach out to kids    especially those from disadvantaged neighborhoods
      where the risks are highest  We give them a chance to realize their own
      potential by giving them a place where they can develop a sense of
      competence  of usefulness  a sense of belonging and of influence 
      To accomplish this  the five area Boys & Girls Clubs of
      Indianapolis must be open and available when the kids need them  with the
      staff and programs the kids need to reach and grow into responsible and
      caring citizens 
      This costs money  Money for programs  for equipment  and for repairs
      and improvements to club facilities  Your contribution last year of
      helped us get where we are today  We are counting on you now to help us
      get where we need to be tomorrow  Would you please consider a gift of the
      same in 1999?
      Please  give generously  The kids are depending on you

         Dear Friend 
         
         As a member of World Wildlife Fund  you know that our efforts are essential to preserving the astonishing 
         yet desperately threatened diversity of life here on Earth 

         I’m also hoping you know that you play a vital role in achieving our conservation goals around the
         globe 

         That’s why I want to extend my appreciation for your last membership contribution of $500  And
         why I’m writing you today to ask you to renew your support for the pivotal year ahead 

         In fact  I want to urge you to strengthen your dedication to saving life on Earth — by sending a generous
         leadership gift of $750 and becoming a member of World Wildlife Funds prestigious Living Planet Society 

         With your increased commitment  we can move forward to thwart the most serious threats to endangered
         ecosystems  After all  conservation begins with saving those at risk places  — our forests and deserts  wetlands and oceans  mangroves and coral reefs — that provide a lifeline for
         precious animals and plants 

         To this end  we’ve designated some 200 ecoregions  those with the most outstanding and diverse habitats  as
         our Global 200  We’re now creating model projects in 25 of these high priority areas    in order to balance
         conservation with people’s need to use natural resources to sustain their livelihoods 

         With your increased commitment  we can intensify our campaigns to protect species that are in grave peril by
         both the loss of habitat and the illegal trading in animal parts 

         Quite simply  WWF must do even more to safeguard the tigers  rhinos  pandas  whales  and other creatures
         that still remain in the wild  While we still have the chance 

         So in addition to our efforts to conserve wildlife preserves  we’ll escalate our trailblazing program to
         find alternatives for traditional tiger based medicines     rescue more rhinos in Kenya and Nepal through our
         ambitious translocation projects     complete the first survey of China’s pandas in over a decade     and fight
         to halt all commercial whaling  as well as the whale meat trade 

         We’ll also award more small grants through our Species Action Fund to help a wide range of animals 
         including whooping cranes  giant river otters  and Tibetan antelopes 

         And with your increased commitment  we can battle against destructive global forces that transcend regional
         and national boundaries  Overfishing  deforestation  climate change  and the proliferation of toxic chemicals
         top the list 

         For instance  our innovative “Forests for Life Campaign” establishes an international network of parks and
         reserves  This will protect at least 10% of each different type of forest found in every country  Another WWF
         goal? To end government subsidies that promote overfishing and to encourage new markets for sustainably managed
         fisheries 

         The challenges we face are daunting  to be sure  However  I’m confident that by joining together again  we
         can make exciting progress in the year ahead  I want to ask you  therefore  to renew your valued World Wildlife
         Fund membership and  hopefully  at the Living Planet Society level of $750 

         When you do  you’ll extend your commitment as an esteemed partner with WWF    the largest and most effective
         international conservation group in existence 

         Now  with your increased commitment  we can save more of our planet’s cherished wild species and their
         irreplaceable habitats     as we strive to ensure a healthy and thriving future for our extraordinary natural
         world 

         Once again  please accept my warmest gratitude for your past support And please  take a moment today to
         renew your critically important WWF annual membership  Thank you 

         Sincerely 
         Kathryn S  Fuller
         President
         P S  As a Living Planet Society member  you’ll receive the wonderful array of benefits described in the enclosed brochure  Plus  to acknowledge your increased gift of $750  we’ll send you a free copy of our stunning coffee table photography book  Living Planet Preserving Edens of the Earth  Please let it be a constant reminder of all you’re doing to preserve our endangered wildlife!

            His belly was empty  So empty it hurt 
            At least Astro could drink water from a puddle
            near the stake he was chained to  But then
            the puddle dried up  Astro had only a few days to live 
            
            
            Dear Friend 
            
            As you read my letter  somewhere    perhaps not far from you   someone is inflicting pain on an innocent animal     an animal like Astro 
            
            You may not be able to rescue that particular animal  But you CAN join the crusade to stop animal abuse and neglect  by making a generous contribution to the ASPCA today 
            
            I have sent you the enclosed complimentary name and address labels to call your attention to the work of the ASPCA  Please USE them on your correspondence to help get our name in front of as many people as possible  Because the ASPCA    and the thousands of animals we help every year   need all the friends we can get!
            
            As a person who cares about animals  you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro  A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate 
            
            When our officers arrived  Astro was too weak to even stand up  The officers knelt down slowly  speaking gently to the emaciated dog 
            
            Then they saw it  Astro was wagging his tail  He was barely moving  but yes    the poor  sick dog was saying  “Welcome  friends!”
            
            The officers brought Astro to the ASPCA’s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital  The dog weighted only 45 pounds    less than half of what a dog his size should weigh    and he had several infections  But with first rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff  he slowly got well again 
            
            Stories like Astro’s are all too common  Every day  the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty  abuse  and neglect  Every day  our officers rescue animals like Sammy  a 10 month old kitten who was deliberately thrown from a high rise window by teenagers 
            
            In a world where cruelty is common  animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you  That is why I have written to you    to ask you to support the ASPCA today 
            
            Our vital anti cruelty efforts are just part of the ASPCA mission  We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals     provide first rate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital     offer low cost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs     reach out to children  teachers  and parents through our Education Programs 
            
            And we don’t stop there  The ASPCA pushes for the passage and strengthening of anti cruelty laws  so that crimes against animals will be treated with the seriousness they deserve 
            
            Since the ASPCA was founded in 1866 as America’ s first humane society  ending cruelty has been our primary goal  Today  over 130 years later  the scope of the problem is greater than ever 
            
            The ASPCA urgently needs your help to push back the tide of violence against animals  The task is too large for the ASPCA to handle without emergency assistance from dedicated friends  That is why I’m asking you to join the ASPCA today with your gift of $20 or more if at all possible 
            
            Your contribution will help us rescue more animals like Astro     make sure the perpetrators of cruelty are brought to justice     nurse abused animals back to health and find them loving adoptive homes  Please help the ASPCA with your most generous gift today    the animals are counting on you 
            
            Sincerely

      Dear  
      Think of your greatest accomplishments  Think of the joy and success
      they bring to you and your loved ones 
      Michael Sims felt that way at age 39    the day he earned a job 
      Michael was born with cerebral palsy  Upon entering the work force  he
      discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities 
      For several years he performed packaging and clerical work  His most
      recent job lasted only a year before cut backs eliminated his
      position 
      For 18 long months Michael could not find a job  He resorted to public
      assistance dollars to survive  Finally  Michael called Goodwill 
      At Goodwill  Michael s counselors felt that his personable demeanor
      could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job match
      where his people skills could shine 
      After three interviews  Michael proved that he was the right person
      for the job  As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments  he now
      provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night 
      At last  he has found success in a job that he loves  Now his goals
      are set on moving up in the company 
      Every year  thousands of people come to Goodwill  Like Michael  they
      share two common characteristics  They face some barrier to employment
      and they want to work 
      With support from people like you  they can overcome their barriers
      and earn success and the self sufficiency that comes with it  And then
      the pay off begins for the entire community 
      Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public
      support and more paying taxes  Last year  participants in Goodwill
      programs earned   and paid taxes on    wages of nearly $3 5 million 
      Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three quarters of
      a million dollars in public assistance 
      The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents  however 
      The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms
      of a house to live in  money to purchase food    without food stamps   
      and the beginning of a family focused on success  not hopelessness 
      Won t you help make all of these successes possible? Please send the
      largest contribution you can comfortably make  Your gift will help give
      new meaning to the word success    for people who have seldom had reason
      to use the word 
      Sincerely 
      James M  McClelland President
      P S  Your gift will make a difference  For every dollar of public
      support Goodwill received last year  we returned $1 59 to the community
      in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments 
    
  


   
      
         
            
            
            I’m outraged     and I think you will be  too!
            
            Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds    among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow acting poison spread in fields miles away 
            
            And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing?
            
            The U S  Department of Agriculture!
            
            In fact  the USDA has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern Great Plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly 70 other bird species 
            
            it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented    in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people 
            
            Thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you  Audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring    but the USDA’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration  unless we act now 
            
            Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake     and how this could set a dangerous precedent  First of all  you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm 
            
            You see  the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities 
            
            So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a “scientific experiment”    to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss 
            
            Can you believe it? The USDA wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds 
            
            And if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory    and show a reduction in crop loss    they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year!
            
            It’s time to tell the USDA  in no uncertain terms 
            
            “YOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS
            
            TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS!”
            
            Because the USDA’s slow acting pesticide takes three days to kill  its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields  before falling to the ground 
            
            Meanwhile blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison  We’ve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison baited areas     including the Bobolink  Grasshopper Sparrow  Harris’ Sparrow and Le Conte’s Sparrow 
            
            In all  nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon’s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields 
            
            We simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past     and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife 
            
            Here’s what I need you to do  to make sure we prevail  First  I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U S  Secretary of Agriculture 
            
            I’ll forward your Petition  along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters  urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds     in favor of alternative  benign methods of protecting sunflower crops 
            
            I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference    just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago!
            
            But today’s battle is one we must win     to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment 
            
            That’s why I hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds  other wildlife and habitat  And with a donation of $15 or more  you’ll receive a FREE Birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern 
            
            I’ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to 
            
            ·Win a ban on the USDA bird poisoning 
            ·Gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws 
            ·Ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science 
            ·Monitor the health of Audubon’s WatchList species 
            ·Conserve America’s remaining grassland habitat 
            
            And Audubon will draw upon its century long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas 
            
            Audubon protects birds  Your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work  designating Important Bird Areas to protect vital habitat     maintaining the WatchList of bird species near endangered status  www audubon org  bird watch      and engaging citizen participation in the vast BirdSource database of North American bird trends 
            
            Audubon rescues endangered wildlife  Nearly 25 years ago  the National Audubon Society helped win passage of the Endangered Species Act  With your help  Audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded  properly implemented  and strongly enforced 
            
            Audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries  “Audubon is truly making a difference for wildlife refuges everywhere” says U S  Fish and Wildlife official Rick Coleman  And your support will help sustain our innovative Audubon Refuge Keepers program  and maintain our own network of more than 100 wildlife centers and sanctuaries 
            
            Audubon restores wetlands  Wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife     they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage  Your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands 
            
            Audubon educates the public  Teaching Americans   particularly young people    how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and I can make for wildlife  That’s why we’re expanding our network of Audubon Centers to reach children and adults in every corner of the nation 
            
            And of course  your support will enable Audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges
              like the USDA’s bird poisoning proposal that I’m asking you to help us defeat today!
            
            So let me urge you to do your part by supporting a group that the San Francisco Chronicle calls “one of America’s most respected and influential conservation organizations 
            
            First sign and return your Petition to the Secretary of Agriculture immediately  to declare a firm and resounding “NO!” to the USDA’s bird poisoning plan 
            
            And I also hope you’ll take a second important step today  by supporting Audubon’s vital conservation work with a generous tax deductible gift  Thank you 
            
            Very truly yours 
            
            
            John Flicker
            President
            
            P S Your gift will help us save birds  other wildlife and their habitat for future generations to cherish  And in thanks for your gift of $15 or more  you 11 receive a FREE Birdfeeder  Supplies are limited     so please respond today!

      Mr  Caring Philanthropy 01234 Giving Way Contribution  USA 56789
      Dear Mr  Philanthropy 
       The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change
      will be made  Do not sit this one out  Do not play it safe  Understand
      the world and change it where it needs to be changed    Make our society
      better  Make a world worthy of the children that your generation will
      bear      Carl Sagan
      You can help make positive changes in the lives of at risk youth in
      central Indiana  We often hear about economic poverty  but what some of
      these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty they have
      often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future  With
      your help  we can change that 
      Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full
      of hope and with a positive outlook  Thanks to our Big Sisters
      volunteers  these young people are self confident  believe in themselves
      and are beginning to realize their full potential  A recent study by
      Public Private Ventures  PPV  showed that girls who had a Big Sister for
      just one year 
      reduced first time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52%
      cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved
      peer and family relationships
      Former Little Sister Amy  now 18 years old  is a testament to the Big
      Sisters program 
       I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992  Since then  she and
      I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new
      things  We go to movies  dinner  concerts  and other stuff like that  but
      I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser
      type things 
      Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister  but I learned a
      lot from her too  I have become more open minded  more responsible  and 
      most importantly  I have gained a lot more self confidence  I am very
      thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special
      opportunity 
      In 1998  Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many
      programs  But the need is still great  Over 170 young people are still
      waiting for a mentor 
      You are an important part in making sure these young people are
      matched with caring adult mentors  Will you make a financial gift to Big
      Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the
      guidance they need  that more young people stay in school  stay off drugs
      and make good choices?
      Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality
      volunteers  It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that
      fosters and supports the development of effective relationships 
      including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and
      support by a professional staff  This year your gift can go farther!
      Gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th
      Anniversary $100 000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For
      Girls Fund  This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring

When an architectural competition was announced for the New York Public Library on May 21  1897  Dr  John Shaw Billings  the library’s executive director  was determined that in his building  design would not triumph over function  He had in mind Boston’s newly built public library  a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building  Billings  an ex army physician  was responsible for organizing the Surgeon General’s Library and a celebrated medical index  He was also an expert in hospital design  and was thus familiar with building construction  He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room  It was not located near the main entrance  as was common practice  but on an upper floor  above the book stacks 
The terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow  There were two stages  intended to attract new talent as well as established firms  First  six architects were chosen from an open competition  These six then advanced to a second stage  where they competed against six invited firms that included not only McKim  Mead & White  the architects of the Boston Public Library   but also such luminaries as Peabody & Stearns  George B  Post  and an up and coming young firm  Carrère & Hastings  The up and comers carried the day  McKim  much to his chagrin  not only lost but placed third behind Howard & Cauldwell  It was his own fault  since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement  Carrère & Hastings conscientiously followed Billings’ requirements 
The projected budget for the new library was not large  $1 7 million  and Billings expected a relatively modest building   That was not what he got  All three designs were monumental  Carrère & Hastings and Howard & Cauldwell used the Modern French style  which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the façade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for  All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors—Corinthian in McKim’s case  Ionic in the other two  the completed building is Corinthian   The compositional strategies were roughly similar  a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor  the entrance was placed in the center  more understated in McKim’s elegant design   statuary and urns adorned the attic  All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate  and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence  dignity  and of culture rooted in the past 
I mentioned the New York Public Library competition when I gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new Salt Lake City Public Library  The library board had conducted a national search for an architect  visited new libraries across the country  and solicited proposals from prominent architects  They had narrowed their list to four firms  Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel are respected New York architects with a long record of university buildings and museums  including a new library of science  industry  and business for the New York Public Library system  Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel  Canada  and the United States  and recently completed the public library in Vancouver  British Columbia  Moore Ruble Yudell is a Los Angeles firm founded by the late Charles Moore  with whom John Ruble and Buzz Yudell built several university libraries and a public library in Berlin  Will Bruder  the least well known of the four  is a southwesterner and the architect of the new  well regarded Phoenix Public Library 
I told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenth century New York counterparts  It was not a question of function  The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements  so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served  As for firmness  I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly  It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder  Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed  understated buildings in a latter day version of the International Style  Safdie  too  is a modernist  but he follows in the footsteps of Pei  and his buildings are frankly monumental—the Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum  Moore Ruble Yudell’s work is different  Informal and animated  their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings  Bruder  on the other hand  designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements  rough industrial materials  and sleek details  Building on the same site  fulfilling the same functional requirements  and using the same up to date construction technology  the four firms would produce libraries that would look different 
The library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie  and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled  The new library will feature an unusual triangular shaped main building and a curving wall like structure that encloses a public square  A hundred years ago  it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style  Today a public library can take many guises  It can be relentlessly avant garde  like the new $1 5 billion national library in Paris  where the books are housed in four L shaped 22 story glass towers  and the readers are lodged in underground rooms  which the London Times described as “a series of rectangular salons  identical of course  where you can admire the ultra smooth gray concrete  steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer ”1 A new library can be comfortably Modernist  like the new British Library in London  which the Independent humorously described as “a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia  having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way ”2 Tom Beeby’s handsome Harold T  Washington Library in Chicago  on the other hand  is distinctly old fashioned  with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the city’s nineteenth century architectural tradition  Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs  the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs  James Ingo Freed’s Main Public Library in San Francisco  on the other hand  is both old and new  the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one façade  and more or less Modernist on another 
The coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new  In a 1913 essay titled “Style in American Architecture ” Ralph Adams Cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles  although he called them “tendencies ” Five were traditional  McKim’s pure Classicism  the Beaux Arts French Modern  Colonial  which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the Johns Hopkins University campus  Cram’s own High Gothic  and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner Goodhue  Two were new  steel frame construction  which Cram described as an enfant terrible  and what he called the Secessionists—Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago  the Greene brothers in Pasadena—who exhibited “a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind ” Cram was not sanguine about the future  but he nevertheless concluded  “Chaos then confronts us  in that there is no single architectural following  but legion  and in that fact lies the honor of our art  for neither is society one  or ever at one with itself ”3
Cram is right  most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion  it is stylistic consensus that is unusual  There was such a brief consensus in the late 1890s  when both architects and the American public  under the influence of the immensely popular World’s Columbian Exposition  embraced Classicism  at least for public buildings  That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition  but it began to unravel shortly after  as Cram’s essay makes clear  There was also a consensus in the 1920s  at least among progressive architects  That consensus did not last either  After 1940  Mies van der Rohe gave up the free flowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House  and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical  In the 1920s  Le Corbusier proclaimed the “Five Points of a New Architecture”  the building raised on stilts  the roof garden  the frame structure that allowed a free plan  the free façade  and the horizontal ribbon window  He  too  had second thoughts  Thirty years later  his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame  the roof  far from being flat  resembled a billowing nun’s coif  Le Corbusier  who had coined the famous expression  “a house is a machine for living in ” now adopted distinctly un machinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete  exposed brick  roughened stucco  and fieldstone  This volte face gave rise to the so called Brutalist style  which had a worldwide influence  shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph  and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moore’s little house in the Berkeley hills 
The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected  The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules  only to bend and break them  Even Classicism  which appears at first glance to be highly regimented  is not immune  As far as we know  the ancient Greeks used only three orders  Doric  Ionic  and Corinthian  Vitruvius describes them  and also refers to a Tuscan order  which is a Roman invention  Roman  too  is the so called Composite order  an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian  The vault  the arch  and the dome  unknown to the Greeks  were other Roman additions to the Classic canon  Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since  breaking pediments  flattening pilasters  magnifying and shrinking columns  rusticating masonry  A sixteenth century French architect  Philibert de l’Orme  invented a French order  Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi  more recently  Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States  Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids  columns carved in the shape of human figures  to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank  While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens  Graves’ caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs 
The headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple  In the past  religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range  As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings  warehouses  factories  shops and cinemas  houses and weekend houses—every sort of building—a single style no longer sufficed  Gothic is an evocative style for churches  but despite Walpole’s efforts it is ill adapted to houses  Romanesque makes imposing city halls  but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers  The International Style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones  Shingle Style cottages are pleasing  a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous  As Cram wisely observed  “Architecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive  and if utterly different things clamor for voicing  different also must be their architectural manifestation ”4
The great architects—Brunelleschi  Palladio  Wren  Richardson  Lutyens—regularly looked to the past for inspiration  In 1965  Richard Meier built the Smith House  which has been called the first International Style revival building  Like all revivalists  Meier picks and chooses  At first glance  the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the 1920s  a free plan  flat roof  white walls  pipe railings  horizontal ribbon windows  a ramp  Yet it is built out of wood and steel  not masonry  The white walls are painted wood siding  not stucco  the details are more refined  the plate glass sheets are larger  the structure lighter  The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology  It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood—the same  but different 
Although art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles  architects look at history differently  “For the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a self conscious act of the ‘modern’ will ” writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture  “but as an enduring fact  an ineliminable part of an extended present ”5 That is why architects  whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn  make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture  Sketchbook in hand  they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past  Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style  they instinctively understand that the history of architecture—including the present—is a continuity rather than a series of episodes 
Stylistic consistency is much admired today  but it was not always so  In 1419  Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence  whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance  At the very same time  he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic  pointed arches and all  The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin  but he also worked in other styles  Gothic in churches  and picturesque Italianate in villas  McKim  Mead & White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences  but built Norman parish churches  Shingle Style summer retreats  French Renaissance mansions  and American Colonial country houses  John Russell Pope  an eclectic master  designed beautiful picturesque Tudor  Georgian  and Colonial country estates  Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclectic 
Domestic architects had to be adaptable  because house styles changed according to fashion  In the United States  Tudor was popular in the 1900s  as was the Free Style  Cotswold and French Provincial appeared in the 1920s  After the 1930s  influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg  American Colonial returned to favor  The Cotswold style  with its relatively severe details and blunt forms  created a very different setting from French Provincial  which tended to have more delicate details  from Free Style with its almost rustic atmosphere  or from sturdy Colonial  Since historic styles carry cultural overtones  using different styles was also a way for architects—and clients—to say different things 
If architectural style is a language—an analogy that is deeply flawed—it is closer to slang than to grammatical prose  Architectural styles are mutable  unregulated  improvised  Architects break the rules  and invent new ones  In part  this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals  In part  architects break stylistic rules because they can  After all  most of the rules that govern building design—fire codes  building codes  zoning laws  budgets  programmatic requirements  engineering norms—are outside the architect’s control  stylistic rules are firmly within his purview  Since architecture is so intensely competitive  doing something unexpected  unusual  or just different is a way to be noticed  to rise above the crowd 
In addition to historical styles  there have also been styles associated with individual architects  The Palladian style made its way from Andrea Palladio to Inigo Jones  from him to Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington  and thence to Thomas Jefferson  It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg  H  H  Richardson’s influence was considerably shorter lived  but for at least 20 years Richardsonian Romanesque rolled over the United States like an “aesthetic Juggernaut ” in Cram’s colorful phrase  Mies van der Rohe’s steel and glass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades  and his characteristic I beam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls 
Buildings like Jones’ Palladian Queen’s House in Greenwich  Adler & Sullivan’s Richardsonian Romanesque Auditorium Building in Chicago  and Gordon Bunshaft’s Miesian Lever House are not copies but satisfying originals  However  most personal styles are not easily adaptable  A building in Wright’s unmistakable Prairie style  for example  simply looks like a knock off  Some personal styles are simply too obsessive  which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaudí never attracted a following 
Inigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio  but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian “style ” any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical “style ” Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all’antica—in the antique manner—they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression  the Romans improved on the Greeks  and they would improved on the Romans  According to the architecture historian Peter Collins  the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late  He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revett’s Antiquities of Athens  published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England  The authors  both architects  referred to “the Grecian and Roman style of building ”6
The Latin root of “style” is stilus  A stilus was the sharp pointed tool used to write on wax tablets and  by inference  stilus also referred to the way that something was written  This sense of technique carried over to English  and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed  The seventeenth century English musical composer Samuel Wesley put it neatly  “Style is the dress of thought ” Jacques François Blondel  who was Louis XV’s architect and who founded the first full time school of architecture in Europe in 1750  adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a building’s character—for example  rustic  regal  or heroic  “Style in the organization of façades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture ” he taught his students  “which alone makes all the architect’s compositions truly interesting ”7
Literary style described the way that something was written  expressed  or performed  Architectural style  in Blondel’s sense  describes the way that something was built  Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space  light  and volume  buildings are above all physical artifacts  The experience of architecture is palpable  the grain of wood  the veined surface of marble  the cold precision of steel  the textured pattern of brick  But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork? We see the joints between the bricks and the mortar  which can be flush  or scraped out to create shadows  the bonding patterns  the way that the bricks turn the corner  the surrounding of openings  and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves  What we see are details 
Details are a major preoccupation of the architect  Once the overall form of a building is determined—“the masterly  correct  and magnificent play of masses brought together in light”—there remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled  but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed  from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards 
The function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor  and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing  There are dozens of ways that this can be done  Baseboards can be prominent or discreet  a complicated assembly of board  cap and base  or a simple strip of hardwood  Or nothing—many modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether  The baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall  They are not wood but cast iron  since they are really disguised radiators  My house was built in 1908  influenced by the British Free Style of Voysey and Baillie Scott  and to further preserve a simple  rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboards radiators painted to resemble wood 
Railings have a simple function—they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them  and they must provide a secure hand hold  if railings are open  the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through  Classical railings  developed during the Renaissance  consist of balusters supporting a handrail  Balusters—little columns—can have a single or a double swelling curve  or a vase shape  Fabricated in wood or masonry  they can be round or square in cross section  and plain or highly ornamented  Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens  These can be stone or metal  bronze  wrought  or cast iron  The screens can be simple X shapes  intertwining geometrical patterns  or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases  Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps  whose builders mimicked X shaped wrought iron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks 
Modern railings are usually metal  In his early villas  Le Corbusier used white painted pipe railings to create a nautical image  in later buildings like the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard  flat steel bars take the place of pipes  The railings in Mies van der Rohe’s buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail  located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor  the vertical stanchions  the handrail  and the rail are made of identical square steel bars  The railings in Louis Kahn buildings tend to be parapets  but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible  I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar  bent at each end to form the uprights  Richard Meier uses metal railings  too  but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails  the visual effect is more pronounced—they resemble staffs in sheet music 
When Brutalism was in fashion  railings were correspondingly heavy  concrete beams  wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch  or massive wood balustrades  as solid as fenders on a truck dock  The vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction  and railings reflect that fashion  too  The screens of the railings of Peter Rose’s Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industrial looking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum  prominently bolted to the stanchions  Bernard Tschumi substitutes steel cables  complete with turnbuckles  for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of Lerner Hall at Columbia University  another nautical reference  but to a yacht rather than a steamship  These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I  M  Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery  The stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rose colored Tennessee marble by appearing to float in mid air  since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floor 
The transparent railings of I  M  Pei’s East Building are understated  elegant  and luxurious—like the building  “Beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts ” taught Palladio  “of the parts with regard to each other  and of these again to the whole ”8 The successful relationship of the details to each other  and to the building is governed by the architect’s sense of style  That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood  a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver  a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall  The role of details is not to complement architecture  details are architecture  “The aesthetic understanding  of architecture  ” writes Roger Scruton  “is inseparable from a sense of detail ”9 Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said “God is in the details ”  He did not mean that details are functionally important  although they are   or that good details prolong the life of a building  although they do   He meant that details are the soul of architecture  That is why  just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards  or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments  it is possible to divine the architect’s idea of a building by examining its details 
The house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in 1964 shook the foundations of the International Style  much of this effect was the result of details  Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom—there is a strip window and a steel pipe railing—he also incorporated distinctly un Modernist features such as trim  both inside and out  Classical architects use a large variety of moldings—fillet  astragal  egg and dart  ogee—that can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect  The International Style  in its effort to do away with ornament  outlawed trim  Walls were flat planes  Windows had no frames  Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks  The conspicuous exterior dado  the baseboards  and the chair rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings—they were merely boards with chamfered edges—yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible 
Coming through the front door of the Vanna Venturi House one immediately senses that it is an unusual place  A broad stair rises beside the fireplace  then peters out to almost nothing  The fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture  but it has a traditional mantelpiece  A free standing column à la Corbusier stands beside a chair rail  Then there is the furniture  Ever since the Tugendhat House—for which Mies had designed the furniture—it was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture  Venturi has explained that “I designed the house so my mother’s old furniture  c  1925  plus some antiques  would look good in it ”10 Instead of the iconic bent tube Breuer chairs  there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table  instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman  a comfortable stuffed sofa  It is a contradictory atmosphere—the International Style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticity 
Whether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon  descending the spiraling vortex of Wright’s Guggenheim Museum  or standing in the living room of Venturi’s small house  the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate  distinct world  That is what distinguishes architecture from sculpture—it is not an object but a place  The sense of being in a special place that is a three dimensional expression of the architect’s imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture  To create a strong sense of place  the surroundings must be all of a piece  space  mass  shapes  and materials must reflect the same sensibility  That is why details are so important  A jarring detail or an inconsistency—something “out of place”—and the fantasy begins to crumble  Yes  fantasy  Illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient Greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye  This is not to say that architecture is stage décor  When the wind blows  the canvas scenery blows over  the building resists the elements  Architecture surrounds and shelters us  It is the real world but it is also a vision 
•••
The Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively short lived but it had an important consequence  it broke the stranglehold of Modernism  leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression  The profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects  Allan Greenberg  Hugh Newell Jacobsen  and Enrique Norten 
Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist  He does not consider this an anomaly  “To be truly modern ” he writes  “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present  Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed ”11 Although Greenberg looks to the past  his is not the attitude of an archeologist  Like Carrère & Hastings  and generations of architects before them  Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied  absorbed—then extended 
Early in his career  after emigrating to the United States from South Africa  Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses  which led to an unusual commission  the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse  He gave the commercial building in Manchester  Connecticut  a new façade dominated by a large arch  over scaled voussoirs  and a pediment  Inside  the barrel vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order  Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965  and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism  However  unlike Venturi and Moore  Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building  he was returning to Classical roots  From this modest beginning  over the next two decades  came a variety of commissions  a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building  several college and university buildings  and a Roman Catholic church  His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens  Georgia  a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan  and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills  Greenberg is also known for large country houses  both in the United States and in Europe  Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope  he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles  One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon  another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene  Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim  Mead & White 
One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard  Completed in 1992  the low lying building is shingled  but it is not exactly Shingle Style  Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts  giving them a fussy and nervous appearance  Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away  Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub  The one story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical  a large arched window flanked by two semi circular bays  rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds  The two story landward side is more informal  ringed by a sheltered porch  Massivity informs the details  sturdy Tuscan columns  a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof  rugged window frames  The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy  the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves  Inside  the fireplace has a brick hearth  a slate lintel  and a wood surround  whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece  The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough  reused timbers  Although most people would describe this house as “traditional ” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style  There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C  F  A  Voysey  and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens’ country houses  But this is a modern house  although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility  It admirably fulfills Palladio’s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole 
Hugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn  worked for Philip Johnson  and opened his own office in 1958  He established himself as a premier residential architect  winning commissions in the United States and abroad and receiving numerous design awards  Several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings  notably the Renwick Gallery in Washington  D C   and the Hôtel Talleyrand in Paris  A Modernist by training and inclination  Jacobsen was  nevertheless  affected by the winds of change unleashed by Venturi’s little house  Starting in 1980  he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision  spareness  and simplicity  A house on Nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined  elegant details such as tall French doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors  A post and beam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack  The Palladian plan and temple like pavilions of an Ohio residence pay homage to the local Greek Revival  An Ohio country house recalls a board and batten Gothic Revival farmhouse  “I endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging ” Jacobsen says  “buildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materials ”12
The Palmedo House  built in 1988  reinterprets the American Colonial architecture of its location—Long Island  At first glance  the six pavilions resemble a little village  a little Amish village  judging from the austere white wood siding  the prim details  and the identical pitched roofs  Each pavilion is a perfect little “house” with identical square and vertical multi paned windows  that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets   This sounds precious  but Jacobsen is not a romantic  The central “house” contains the living room  a three story space open to the roof  Although the multi paned windows are present at an upper level of the wall  the corner of the room is glazed with large  mullionless sheets of plate glass  offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound  This is an International Style device  as is the economy of detail and the clean  cool  atmosphere of the interior  On the other hand  the fireplace  which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bush hammered concrete  is decorously built into the wall  which gives the room a traditional  civilized air  The chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new  between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life  Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension  Jacobsen allows it to surface  If this sounds like textbook Postmodernism  it is not  Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony 
Jacobsen reacts to the collapse of Modernism by seeking a compromise position  while Greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of Classicism  Enrique Norten  the youngest of the three  takes a different course—he is trying to put Modernism back together again  Norten  who studied at Cornell  established his office in his native Mexico City in 1985  In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional  commercial  and residential buildings  His major projects are a services building for the media giant TELEVISA and the National School of Theater  Both incorporate bulging  metal shell roofs that recall the 1950s buildings of the French architect engineer Jean Prouvé  Prouvé was intent on applying new methods of construction  particularly industrialization and prefabrication  His buildings  extremely light and assembled from standardized elements  were real “machines for living ” Norten  too  is preoccupied with industrial building technologies  the lighter the better  Double tensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steel frame  Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts  Slender  canted columns brace a glass roofed portico  Railings  in a Norten design  are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain  suspended sheets of glass  stretched steel cables  perforated metal screens 
In 1994  Norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in Mexico City  The three story street façade is mostly a blank concrete wall  the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass  The main living floor is open  except for the kitchen  the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood  louvered screen  A functionalist style pervades the house  The clinical cabinetwork is white painted wood  A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks  The windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames  a 10 foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio  The sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in Mies van der Rohe’s Tugendhat House  but the resemblance ends here  Mies’ spare interior is opulent and assertive  Norten’s is austere  almost monastic  a neutral background for family life  This is an unsentimental idea of the home  Not exactly a “machine for living ” but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layout 
Like Greenberg and Jacobsen  Norten reflects on the past  Although his house has little to do formally with the International Style of the flat roofed stucco villas of the 1920s—except for the white painted circular steel columns—it shares that period’s ambitions  it is highly abstract  idealistic  technophile  and lacking in applied ornament  Decoration results not from trim  but from the surface quality of the different materials—concrete  red oak flooring  etched glass—and from the relentless articulation of structural connections  Norten’s buildings exhibit another feature of the International Style  they are placeless  That is  while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site  they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context  Whether they are in Mexico or New Mexico—where Norten is building a heritage center—the style is the same  understated  coolly competent  cosmopolitan 
Whether one prefers the work of Greenberg  Jacobsen  or Norten is a matter of taste  I happen to like all three   The buildings are different  yet the three architects have something in common  They are serious about what they are doing  that is  their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction  They pay enormous attention to details  They are disciplined  but they understand their self imposed rules well enough to occasionally break them  Moreover  while their architecture is built with a great sense of style  it is never merely stylized  That is because in their buildings  style—the manner of expression—is always in the service of content—that which is being expressed  Style without content quickly degenerates into caricature  like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes  but has nothing to say  The buildings of Greenberg  Jacobsen  and Norten  on the contrary  have a great deal to tell us about our past  our surroundings  and ourselves 
Greenberg  Jacobsen  and Norten do not describe what they do in terms of style  I think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject  A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement  which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion  while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency  So deep rooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects  whether or not they are Modernists  Perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear  Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box—like most creative people  architects dislike being categorized  Also fear that talking about style will make architecture—a serious business—sound frivolous  Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers  professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy  Finally  there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion  That fear  at least  seems to me to be ill founded  An architecture that recognizes style—and fashion—would not be an architecture that is introspective and self referential  as are so many contemporary buildings  It would be part of the world—not architecture for architects  but architecture for the rest of us  And that would not be a bad thing

Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century  His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works  the centerpiece building of the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition  and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty  He was feted at home and abroad  Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects  and he was made an honorary member of the French Académie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor  A hundred years later  his counterpart is Frank O  Gehry  Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989  Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect  including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize  a non architectural award of which he is the first recipient  and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale  the Nobel of the art world  Even the staid American Institute of Architects  which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners  awarded him its top accolade  the AIA Gold Medal 
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple  the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica  Yet they bear comparison  They were both late bloomers  Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition  Until then  he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years  building shopping centers  suburban offices  department stores  and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L A  modern  The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house  a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood  corrugated metal  and chain link fencing  The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick  That was in 1978  Unexpectedly  he attracted a broad range of commissions  not only residential clients  but also museums  public institutions  universities  corporations  and developers  and not only in the United States but around the world 
Hunt was 43 when he came into his own  He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855  almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux Arts  He was moderately successful  achieving local renown for the Tribune Building  an early New York skyscraper  Despite his Parisian background  Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style  Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan  the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote  “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick  and very irregular stone dressings  which  it must be confessed regretfully  are not pleasing to the eye ”3 For his next project  the Lenox Library  Hunt tried something different  He borrowed from the French Neo Grec style  popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève  adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling  The result was a startling departure from convention  a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity  The Lenox Library  which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present day Frick Collection  marked a shift in architectural taste  away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism  The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity  and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt’s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display  He obliged them in a string of high profile commissions  magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue  country houses on Long Island  and palatial “cottages” in Newport  Rhode Island  Hunt died in 1895  but in the last seven years of his life  he completed more than fifty projects 
Biltmore House in Asheville  North Carolina  is a good example of his stylistic prowess  Hunt modeled the design of this 250 room residence on the Château de Blois  whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim  but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance  To a modern visitor  the spires  turrets  and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle  which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau—the Château d’Ussé—as his model  But the comparison does Hunt an injustice  for his design is neither prettified nor quaint  His client  George W  Vanderbilt  was a young bachelor  he married soon after the house was finished   and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust  masculine  and immensely self assured  not in the least like a fairytale 
Vanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux  which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour  since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats  There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house  Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting  but deals with the past in his own peculiar way  Although he modeled the building on Blois  he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth century chateau  but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole  Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenth century building—there is no artificial weathering  no aging effect no simulated historicism  The interior is modern  bright  and open  The focus of the main floor is a glass roofed conservatory  a common nineteenth century feature  The stonework of the house is impeccable  much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois  Hunt was no antiquarian  and modern American technology abounds  The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses  Cast iron replaces wrought iron and high quality bricks  fired in the estate brickworks  back up the limestone walls  Equally novel are the elevators and telephones  electrical lighting  hot and cold running water  and forced air central heating  There is no doubt that for Hunt  Biltmore is an up to the minute modern building  That is part of its style  too 
Like Hunt  Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings  The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao  Spain  for example  is clad in titanium  previously used chiefly for building aircraft  The metallic walls curve  twist  and turn  One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge  another emerges from a reflecting pool  Bilbainos refer to the museum as the “artichoke ” which comes close to describing it  if you can imagine a gleaming  metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high  The seeming disorder—a chaotic collision of forms—has no architectural precedent  This is not sculptural architecture  it is walk in sculpture 
“The plan is the generator” preached Le Corbusier  but with Gehry  the plan is the result  He appears to design from the outside in  The building as a composition comes first  the interior spaces follow  This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building  which is not the case  The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces  traditional  skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art  a long boat like space for temporary installations  and 11 smaller galleries  each with its own character  each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist  The artichoke accommodates them all  The building may appear offhanded  but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized 
Gehry’s talent is his exceptional formal imagination  his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client  And  of course  to find ways to build those forms  This is generally done without fuss  The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof  limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion  without articulated joints  Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style  but he deploys these details to different ends  By removing familiar elements such as coping strips  fascias  and trim  he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings  There are no roofs or walls or windows in the Guggenheim  there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal  stone  and glass  An architecture critic once described Gehry as “a smart man from Hollywood ” which nicely captures the architect’s blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behind the scenes savvy 
Although sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehry’s buildings  like Hunt  he keeps technology off center stage  In that regard  he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects  Neither is he nostalgic about the past  Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism  Architects have broken rules in the past  but rarely this unequivocally and totally 
Gehry  like Hunt  has changed the course of architecture  That is  he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way  The world of Gehry’s buildings is  at first glance  an odd place  The line between order and disorder is a thin one  and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental  But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening  This is the way we live today  Gehry seems to be saying  why not enjoy it?









Deformation and river response 

Before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed  a brief review of types of tectonic activity  types of rivers  and river response will be presented  This background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow  

Types of deformation

The surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms  as illustrated in Figure 2 1  The displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting  or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor  Faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel  Figure 2 1A  without vertical displacement  This type of displacement should be easily recognized  Faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened  Figure 2 1B   In the opposite case  the gradient will be decreased  Figure 2 1C   The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting  Figure 2 1F  G   Pairs of faults may produce uplifted  horst  or downdropped blocks  graben  that will both steepen and reduce gradient  Figure 2 1D  E   This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines  Figure 2 1H  I   

In addition to all of these structural features  the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain  Figure 2 1J  K  L   The possibilities are great  but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or cross valley tilting  

Streams respond to vertical displacement along faults  Figure 2 1B and C  by aggradation or degradation  When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient  Figure 2 1B   erosion will be initiated in this reach  When the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream  Figure 2 1C   aggradation will occur  Even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams  If the displacement forms a dam  Figure 2 1C   the stream will be blocked  and it will flow along the fault or form a lake  Wallace  1968  mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream  which can divert its course

Figure 2 1 Surface deformation by faulting  folding  and lateral tilting  Plan view on left  cross section on right  from Ouchi  1983  small arrows indicate direction of flow  Large arrows indicate direction of movement  The displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated  

Horst and graben  Figure 2 1D and E  combine two different types of vertical displacement  Figure 2 1B and C   There will be aggradation upstream from the horst  and degradation  which will migrate upstream  on the downstream part of the horst  Reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation  Upstream of the graben  there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself  A river in such a location will be unstable  as Cartier and Alt  1982  suggested for the Bitterroot River in Montana  

The type of folding  Figure 2 1  will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting  but changes will probably be less abrupt  The effects of tilting will depend upon the amount  but in the simplest case  steepening of a valley will cause degradation  Figure 2 1K  and a reverse tilt  Figure 2 1L  will cause deposition  Lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip  Figure 2 1J  or avulsion  

Figure 2 1 shows only simple  but exaggerated cases  whereas actual displacements can be more complicated  For example  faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction  Fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious  and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed  For example  small stream channels have been offset by strike slip movement  Figures 1 8  2 1A  of the San Andreas fault  Wallace  1968  pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes  The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault  20 3 mm year  Brown and Wallace  1968  and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault  While fault displacements are obvious  movements of the land surface by folding can be slow  However  this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior  For example  concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt  Jefferson  1907  Nanson  1980a  Leeder and Alexander  1987   

Types of alluvial rivers

It is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation  therefore  their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated  This can best be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern  

Five basic channel patterns exist  Figure 2 2    1  straight channels with either migrating sand waves  or  2  with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg   3  two types of meandering channels  a highly sinuous channel of equal width  pattern 3a  and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings  pattern 3b    4  the meandering–braided transition  and  5  a typical braided stream  The relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels  as related to relative sediment size  load  velocity of flow  and stream power  are also indicated in Figure 2 2  It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient  sediment load  stream power  and the type of sediment load transported by the channel  Schumm and Kahn  1972   Therefore  alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels  as suspended load  mixed load  and bed load channels  Figure 2 2   Water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel  width  depth  meander dimensions   but the relative proportions of bed load  sand and gravel  and suspended load  silts and clays  determine not only the shape of the channel but width–depth ratio and channel pattern  A suspended load channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a bed load channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load  Schumm  1977   The mixed load channel lies between these two  Figure 2 2   

NULL

Figure 2 2 Channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated  Schumm  1981   

Alluvial rivers that transport clay  silt  sand  and gravel  can be placed within these three general categories  However  within the meandering stream group there is considerable range of sinuosity  1 25 to 3 0   In addition  in the braided stream category  there are bar braided and island braided channels  islands are vegetated bars   

Figure 2 2 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum  but experimental work and field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided  meandering  and straight  occur relatively abruptly at river pattern thresholds  Figure 2 3   The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power  gradient  and sediment load  Schumm and Kahn  1972   

NULL

Figure 2 3 Relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge  Sediment load  stream power  velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables  from Schumm and Khan  1972   

Although the five patterns of Figure 2 2 involve all three river types  there are five basic bed load channel patterns  Figure 2 4A  that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns  Schumm  1977  p  158   These five basic bed load channel patterns can be extended to mixed load and suspended load channels to produce 13 river patterns  Figure 2 4   Patterns 1–5 are bed load channel patterns  patterns 6–10 are mixed load channel patterns  and patterns 11–13 are suspended load channel patterns  Figure 2 4 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope  stream power and sediment load for each channel type  The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load  but within each type  the different patterns reflect increased valley slope  sediment load  and stream power  

The different bed load channel patterns  Figure 2 4  can be described as follows  Pattern 1  straight  essentially equal width channel with migrating sand waves  Pattern 2  alternate bar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg  Pattern 3  low sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes  Pattern 4  transitional meandering thalweg braided channel  The large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes  but a meandering thalweg can be identified  Pattern 5 is a typical bar braided channel  

As compared to the bed load channels  the five mixed load channels  Figure 2 4B  are relatively narrower and deeper  and there is greater bank stability  The higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow  deep  straight channels  Pattern 6   and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels  Pattern 7   Pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel  wide on the bends  relatively narrow at the crossings  and subject to chute cutoffs  Pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel  but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuous braided appearance  Pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bed load channel 5  and it is likely to be island braided

Suspended load channels  Figure 2 4C  are narrow and deeper than mixed load channels  Suspended load Pattern 11 is a straight  narrow  deep channel  With only small quantities of bed load  this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all  Patterns 12 and 13   

Rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely  That is  a suspended load channel  Pattern 12  could become braided  Pattern 5   or a braided channel  Pattern 5  could become meandering  Pattern 8 or 12   etc   when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel  Therefore  the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common  as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions  or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics  

There is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of Figure 2 4  This is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments  Schumm et al   1996   The channel segments can be straight  meandering  or braided  and they appear to span the range of channel types  Anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain  Figure 2 5   whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel  Knighton and Nanson  1993  and Richards et al   1993  suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys  Smith and Smith  1980  and tectonic uplift  Gregory and Schumm  1987   Reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important  and therefore  anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity  

Evidence of deformation 

The first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from long continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces  These obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers  

Drainage networks

The arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops  climate  and the erodibility of the surface material  Local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern  Figure 1 2   For example  experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 2 5 percent  whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes  Phillips and Schumm  1987   

NULL

Figure 2 5 Map of anastomosing channels of Ovens and King Rivers  Numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest  1  to oldest  4   from Schumm et al   1996   

Local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns  A topographic high caused by active uplift  will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern  For instance  on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope  This can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network  An uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope  Figure 2 6   As the major streams are deflected away from the uplift  tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened  

Changes of an entire drainage network  as a result of tilting  are described by Sparling  1967  who notes that isostatic adjustment in Ottawa County  Ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others  Incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient  Russell  1939  described various drainage patterns found in the flat alluvial lands of Louisiana  and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern  as a result of tilting and steepening of the gradient

Price and Whetstone  1977  used asymmetric river and valley cross section profiles  as evidence for movement along the Chattahoochee Embayment in Florida  Subsidence caused southward migration of east–west flowing channels  South flowing streams exhibit paired terraces while east–west trending streams contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin  Subsidence in the Chattahoochee Embayment and adjacent warping along the Chattahoochee Uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the Chattahoochee River  

Long continued tilting in a cross valley direction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network  Muehlberger  1979  noted this type of asymmetry in an area near Taos  New Mexico  Figure 2 7   Using 71⁄minute U S  Geological Survey topographic

2 maps  he described this asymmetry quantitatively  By selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to this contour in a down tilt direction  Dd  and in the opposite  uptilt direction  Du  an index of asymmetry was developed  Dd Du   Figure 2 7   The index for 30 small drainage basins was 0 6 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a down tilt direction  Cox  1994  used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern Mississippi Embayment  Other indices of asymmetry are described by Keller and Pinter  1996  pp  126  127

Lake patterns

Lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time  but they can be clear evidence of deformation  They occur at various scales  along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network  and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time  They may be isolated  but they are more frequently clustered in a specific area  or they are aligned along specific trends  Isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses  which form a dam  but clustered lakes are due to regional processes  which may be related to climate  or paleoclimate   neotectonic deformation  or frequently a combination of these processes  

Large lakes may occupy geological basins  and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation  Such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations  The Bolivian Altiplano lakes  Titicaca  Popoo  Uyuni  stand at an elevation of around 4000 m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift  Continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes  Often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious  and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics   See Chapter 5 where Reelfoot Lake and the Mississippi valley sunklands are described  Figures 5 1  5 2

This discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns   ria lakes and elongated lakes   are related to active deformation  Most of these concepts are not new  For example  the significance of ria lakes was identified more than 30 years ago  

Ria Lakes 

Dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary  which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river  Holz et al   1979   In the lower and central parts of the Amazonian Basin the formation of ria lakes is related to post glacial eustacy  Irion  1984   Some of these lakes have a “knee” pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover  Sternberg  1950  1955  Figure 2 8

Reservoirs behind dams take the form of ria lakes  Clusters of ria lakes are observed along large rivers in the western Marañón Basin and in the central Ucayali Basin  Peru  Räsänen et al   1987  Dumont  1993   They are related to active subsidence of the back side of piggy back or thrust faults  Similar patterns are observed on the south margin of the Beni Basin  Dumont  1992  Dumont and Guyot  1993   

An elongated cluster of ria lakes is located along the lower Pastaza River and the Marañón River in the western part of the Marañón Basin  Figure 2 9   This cluster is superimposed over the structural axis of the basin  which trends toward the Ucamara Depression  This axis of maximum subsidence of the basin is located in front of the Subandean Thrust and Fault Belt  STFB

A continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earth’s surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers  For example  Lake Victoria is drained by the Victoria Nile which flows north to Lake Kyoga  Figure 2 11   Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania look artificial  but they are not the result of dam construction  They are  in fact  formed by uplift and eastward tilting of western Uganda  Flow in the Kafu River has been reversed  and water draining from Lake Victoria has found a new course to the north  where it flows over Murchison Falls and into Lake Albert  The geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time  Doornkamp and Temple  1966

Elongated lakes 

The term elongated lakes is applied to lakes that are long and narrow  These lakes are superimposed over basement structures  In subsiding basins  they are also closely related to active tectonics  

The Puinahua  1324 km2  and Punga  341 km2  lakes are both located in the south part of the Marañón Basin  Figure 2 10   They are long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side  Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift  Dumont and Garcia  1991   which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata  Laurent  1985   The NE elongation of the lake is parallel to a few of the structural features mentioned by Laurent  1985   Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW–SSE extension in the upland border  Dumont et al   1988   As a result  the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of Andean tectonics  Dumont and Garcia  1991   

More precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the Punga Lake  According to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals  Stiglish  1904  the area was covered by forest  that developed on a terrace before 1923  Then the region began to subside  The tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible  now below 2 m of water during low water stages  In this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods  suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years  A tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of base level cannot be involved  Only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon  These lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system  

Terraces

The vertical warping of terraces  as a result of deformation  has been studied by numerous investigators  Machida  1960  Zuchiewicz  1980  King and Stein  1983   The offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement  The offset terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge in New Zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement  Figure 2 12   In addition to river terraces  the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces  Keller and Pinter  1996  are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level  An example is the isostatic deformation of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville shorelines  Utah  Crittenden  1963   Portions of the Lake Bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as 210 feet  as it drained and evaporated to form Great Salt Lake  In addition  deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the Pacific Coast of Baja  California  Orme  1980   Not only are terraces deformed  but as an uplift is crossed  a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace  This will  of course  dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach  

In addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above  evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleosoils  Machette  1978  Keller et al   1982  Bull  1984  Rockwell et al   1984  Rockwell  1988  by variations in gradients of streams of different orders  Merritts and Vincent  1989  Merritts and Hesterberg  1994  and by variations of valley and river longitudinal profiles  Volkov et al   1967  Seeber and Gornitz  1983

River response 

The clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes  Structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years that rivers are strong indicators of faulting  Lattman  1959  Howard  1967   

Tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior  and this is especially true of alluvial rivers  Neef  1966  and Radulescu  1962  state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope  such as meander characteristics  In addition  the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley  Clearly  one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream  Bendefy et al   1967  Zuchiewicz  1979   

Alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change  In order to maintain a constant gradient  a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid  whereas a reduction of valley slope will lead to a reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change  For example  Twidale  1966  reported that both the Flinders and Leichardt Rivers have changed to a braided pattern  as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the Selwyn Upwarp in northern Queensland  Australia  and the Red River near Winnipeg  Canada is straightening  as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound  Welch  1973   Other examples are provided by the Mississippi River between St  Louis and Cairo and the lower Missouri River  Adams  1980  as well as the Red River of the North near Winnipeg  Canada  Vanicek and Nagy  1980   

Baselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics  and can provide information on channel change  For example  if sea level is lowered  and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed  the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift  Lane  1955  argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river  Indeed  Lane’s  1955  argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade  then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel  the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished  However  sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation  Another fallacy in Lane’s argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical  This is not the case  and the two dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions  For example  a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor  

Sinuosity  P  is the ratio between channel length  L c  and valley length  L v   and it is also the ratio between valley slope  S v  and channel gradient  S c  as follows  



Therefore  a straight channel has a sinuosity of 1 0  and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same  It has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes  Schumm  1968   and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the Mississippi  Indus  and Nile  reflect the variability of the valley slope  Schumm et al   1994  Jorgensen et al   1993  Schumm and Galay  1994

Figure 2 13 Effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern  See text for discussion  

Figure 2 13 illustrates this concept geometrically  and it shows the impact of the lowering of baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity  P  1 5  The line A–C represents the channel profile  and the line A–B represents the profile of the valley floor  Points B and C are at the river mouth  and points F and G are at the same location in the valley  The channel distance is one third longer than the valley distance  and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream  The length of the channel is 1 5 times the length of the valley and  therefore  the stream gradient is one third less than the valley slope  equation 1   If a vertical fall of baselevel from B to D and C to E is assumed  channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor  If the channel is not confined laterally  it can adjust to the increased valley slope  F–D  by increasing sinuosity to 2 0  and the channel profile is extended to H  In this case  incision ceases at point F in the valley and at point G in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 1 5 to 2 0 from G to H maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope  F–D   The one third increase of channel length  sinuosity  between G and H compensates for a one third steepening of the valley floor from F to D  

According to Lane’s assumptions  the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point A  where an amount of erosion equal to B–D would occur  However  because the stream can adjust  the steepening of the valley floor will not result in a change of stream gradient  Rather the channel lengthens  and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream  The distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor  but this exercise supports Saucier’s  1991  contention that Pleistocene sea level change in the lower Mississippi valley was effective only as far as Baton Rouge  see also Blum  1993 and Blum and Valastro  1994   The probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly  unlike during the experimental studies  The river  therefore  has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity  

Further evidence for the type of channel response shown in Figure 2 13 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of Jeff Ware  1992 oral comm    He lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 18 4 m  This change would have doubled the channel gradient  However  the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only 4 m upstream  and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 1 2 to 1 5 in the lower 4 m in the flume  It is clear  however  that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel  This channel widened and roughness increased  thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change  

Ware’s experiments showed that a sinuosity increase  which resulted in a slope decrease  was only part of the adjustment  and width  depth  and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power  Therefore  channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change  The River Nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes  Schumm and Galay  1994   

Changes of valley floor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations  but variations of valley floor slope can be the result of several influences  Tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern  Adams  1980   In addition  a high sediment transporting tributary may build a fan like deposit in the valley  which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased  When the main river crosses this fan  pattern changes will result  as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient  Tributaries to the Jordan River in Israel have developed fan like deposits in the valley  and the valley floor of the Jordan Valley undulates as a result  The Jordan River  as it approaches one of these convexities  straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan  Schumm  1977  p  140   

It is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold  Figure 2 3  may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable  For example  some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load  Schumm  1979   Experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley floor slope will cause a change of channel morphology  The change will differ  however  depending where the channel lies on a plot such as that of Figure 2 3 and depending on the type of channel  Figure 2 4   For example  with increasing slope  a straight channel will become sinuous  a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous  and a meandering channel will braid  With decreasing slope  a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten

Figure 2 14 Reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting  

Although pattern changes may dominate river response  deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient  Figure 2 14   In fact  upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion  Therefore  in addition to the primary valley floor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation  there are third order effects beyond the area of deformation  For example  deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation  Figure 2 14   This means that the uplift is acting as a dam  and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate  erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation  However  it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach  and when this increased load moves downstream  aggradation will result  Figure 2 14

Figure 2 15 Effect of change from weaker  W  to more resistant  R  materials on meander pattern  

Another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades  Resistant alluvium  clay plugs  gravel armor  or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion  The result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact  For example  as meanders shift downvalley  their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered  Jin and Schumm  1987   Hence  a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed  Figure 2 15   A similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or if  as a result of incision  it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course  Yeromenko and Ivanov  1977  reviewed the Russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts  the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures  which supports Gardner’s  1975  observations of bedrock channels in the Colorado Plateau  This is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of Figure 2 3  Therefore  an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone  

Discussion

Alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology  but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial rivers  Rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even  slow  aseismic tectonic activity  For example  evidence of active tectonics is as follows  


	1 
	deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile
	2 
	deformation of channel longitudinal profile
	3 
	change of channel pattern 
	4 
	change of channel width and depth
	5 
	conversion of floodplain to a low terrace
	6 
	reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 
	7 
	effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation  degradation  aggradation  flooding  bank erosion 
	8 
	formation of lakes 


Alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change  but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics  Therefore  it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when  in fact  human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time  Pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics  rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence and or surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation  In many areas  the evidence will be circumstantial  Nevertheless  anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls  tributary influences  lithologic change  or paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise  

Lakes can also provide information on subsidence  and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences  For example  during Pleistocene aggradation in the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys  numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys  Therefore  care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies  








7 The future of boundaryless careers



When massive economic restructuring forced William H  Whyte Jr’s  1956  ‘organization man’ to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation  many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind  In the wake of his departure  people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life  a corporate ‘road map’ to guide their destiny and the firm’s hierarchy to define their status or place in society  Without employers’ orderly structures  external guides for action  and linear career paths  however  just what is the future of career? When ‘the career’ devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of ‘career anarchy’ result? Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing? 

We argue here that the answer is an emphatic ‘yes’  The new environment suggests a shift from pre ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities  As a result a shift from ‘bounded’ careers – prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures – to ‘boundaryless’ careers – where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day – is increasingly common  The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based  and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change  It does not characterise any single career form  but rather ‘a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions’  Arthur & Rousseau  1996  p  6   

The myriad interactions of a boundaryless career over a lifetime of work experiences can appear overwhelming  A complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals  teams  and employers  The interplay may seem downright chaotic  So much so  that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random micro level behaviour  Yet  despite the large amount of publicity generated as ‘organization man’ was shown to the door  a large proportion of people who participate in the work place  and even whole industries  never really played by the traditional rules anyway  For these people and industries the ‘boundaryless career’ is simply business as usual  It is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or – as we see the future – the boundaryless career  

We focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful  involving industries where open labour markets have thrived  Our examination suggests that seemingly random micro level activities result in the creation of emergent pattern and order  Further examination reveals not only order  but remarkable stability  In the absence of external guides  people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments  Moreover  the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that  in turn  introduces new structure  Micro level activities gather the force and the power to shape macro level processes and larger institutions  It is organising  rather than organisation  that is the catch word of the boundaryless career  

In this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers  We present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries  First we present relevant aspects of Karl Weick’s work  1979  1995  and 1996  and discuss the process of ‘enactment’  We then examine the industry cases  We conclude by refining the arguments by noting key behavioural aspects of enactment and other considerations of the process  

An enactment perspective 

Our exploration in this chapter is framed in the social–psychological perspective of Karl Weick  1996   Weick’s work provides a theoretical lens for explaining the processes at work in boundaryless career behaviour  His conception of enactment  directly related to his previous  1995  work on sensemaking  explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers  The enactment view emphasises that action creates the environment  That is  people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds  A simple analogy is with the legal system  People enact laws  which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour  leading people to enact new laws  and so on  A legal system continually evolves from the enactment of individual laws  Similarly  career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers  

Another way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection  According to Weick  1996   careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment  selection  and retention  whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements  From this standpoint  the ‘basic theme for the entire organizing model is found in the following recipe for sensemaking  ‘‘How can I know what I think until I see what I say?’’ ’  Weick  1979  p  133   In the simplest form of the recipe  enactment is ‘saying’  action   selection is ‘seeing what I say’  perception   and retention is ‘knowing what I think’  sensemaking   

If enactment is ‘saying’ then it is  in essence  the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process  When someone takes action  or interacts with their environment  it immediately impacts others and hence the individual produces part of their environment  For example  if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile  when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear  In response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner  The environment becomes hostile  Moreover  you have contributed to ‘enacting’ that hostile environment  The result is a circular self reinforcing relationship resembling a self fulfilling prophecy  An alternative  perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if  instead of fear  you initially showed confidence  

How do we relate this process to boundaryless careers? For this  it is important to understand that there is less room for personal inputs  manoeuvring  or ‘enactment’ if there are clear salient rules and structures defining behaviour  In traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure  hierarchy  plans  detailed job descriptions  prescribed relationships  and established ‘road maps’ provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour  The situation is ‘strong’  Mischel  1968  in as much as it provides little scope for improvisation  

In the pure form of the boundaryless career  however  such explicit guides do not exist  Instead of providing clear guidelines  employment situations are characterised by ambiguity  ‘Weak’ situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them  Mischel  1968   In ‘weak’ situations individuals are not able to interpret events in the same way  and the resulting ambiguity opens the door to myriad personal interpretations and opportunities for enactment  People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system  Weick  1979   People join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour  In the process ‘microstrength shapes macroweaknesses’  Weick  1996  p  44  through the unfolding of boundaryless careers  

To illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weick’s ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian  1996  on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones  1996  on the independent film industry  We reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly re framing them within Weick’s framework  and we emphasise it is these three authors  and their original descriptions and ideas  that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter   

To show how enactment and associated principles of self organising and learning come to life  we will trace the process of enactment in each setting  First  we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example  Next  we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances ‘weak’  After that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment  Finally  we will point out the patterns  order  and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings  By doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates – the boundaryless career  

The Silicon Valley 

The Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms  So much so that the name ‘Silicon Valley’ has come to be synonymous with the electronics industry  The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the world’s most influential firms  including Apple  Hewlett Packard  and Intel  Since its inception the Valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market  Today  the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region  Saxenian  1996   One can argue that the Valley’s ‘boundarylessness’ is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation  Proponents point out that  in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement  knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between co operation and competition  Boundaryless characteristics appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge – rather than capital intensive or when firms operate in economic clusters  

However  other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices  We may  therefore  attribute the ‘boundaryless’ features of the Silicon Valley to its heritage  Some believe this is in part due to the location of the region  hosting a ‘West Coast’ Northern Californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established ‘East Coast’ industry  The greenfield site had an empty slate and no institutional rules  Others  like the late William Hewlett  a key and highly influential founder of the region  believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market  Hewlett ‘routinely offered the following advice       ‘‘If you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things  change jobs often  talk to your competitors and take risks – even if it means failing’’ ’  Saxenian  1996  p  23   Hewlett was himself influenced by his Stanford Dean of Engineering William Terman  a mentor and an influential Hewlett Packard board member  Collins & Porras  1995   Today  Hewlett’s and Terman’s philosophy permeates the region  Despite fierce inter firm competition  open information exchange is common practice among the region’s producers  

Several features of the Valley contribute to creating a ‘weak’ environment  The high pace of technology and product life cycles  fluidity of firm formation and failure  rapid employee turnover resulting in little com pany specific socialisation  as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy  all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour  For example  in the Valley  technology moves quickly and competition is tough  New firms form almost overnight  and many disappear just as quickly  When firms come and go like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession  not their company  Moreover  people’s loyalty is not only to their profession  but to the host industry region  ‘As one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted  ‘‘Many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for Silicon Valley Inc ’’ ’  Saxenian  1996  p  23   They view job changing as the norm  

Average job tenure is in the area of two years  and annual turnover is around 35%  and often higher for smaller firms  Saxenian  1996   As one engineer explained  ‘two or three years is about the max  at a job  for the Valley because there’s always something more interesting across the street’  Saxenian  p  28   Knowledge and practices cross company borders at a pace that defies the embedding of ‘routines’ within the boundaries of any single company  and instead favours inter company exchange  Everyone knows that  upon leaving a company  they may well work together again in the future  ‘A colleague might become a customer or a competitor  today’s boss could be tomorrow’s subordinate’  Saxenian  p  29   Institutionally based hierarchy  therefore  loses its saliency  In the Valley  respect and authority are gained through competence  technical excellence  and market share  with the highest regard accorded to successful entrepreneurs  

In the context of this ‘weak’ environment  clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro level  People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings  In the Valley  information is the life blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career  People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community  Learning takes place in the pub or club  In the Valley’s early days  it used to take place in the infamous Wagon Wheel Bar and the Homebrew Computer Club  Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valley’s high technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work  In these meeting places  people gather to see old friends  gossip  and make new acquaintances  In the workers’ adopted social settings  the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally  

In the Silicon Valley  collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests  intellectual curiosity  and problem solving geared towards developing new markets  technologies  products  or applications for computers  Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field  As one engineer explained  the process is quite simple  ‘people rub shoulders and share ideas’  Saxenian  p  27   The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many ‘local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business’  Saxenian  p  26  As one local manager claimed  ‘‘‘Over a lunch conversation or a beer  you’ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want       If it fits your needs  you’ll build it into your next product’’’  Saxenian  p  31   In this manner  micro level conversations influence the creation of new technologies  products  and applications  

It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley  In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning  employees in the Valley rely on their skills  rather than on formal position  to provide a reference point for their careers  Such self generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks  which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry  These networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres  As one engineer reported  ‘‘‘You don’t just hire people out of the blue  In general  it’s people you know  or you know someone who knows them’’’  Saxenian  p  27   Social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations  It is the region and its relationships  rather than the firm  that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley  Saxenian  1996   

Thus  while Silicon Valley’s high rates of job mobility and new firm formation lead to local losses for individual firms  they also foster a dynamic process of adaptation that spurs the evolution of the region  Knowledge of the latest techniques in design  production  and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area  The result is an exceptional rate of technical and organisational innovation created by a ‘complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition’  Saxenian  1996  p  25   The resilience of Silicon Valley’s economy shows that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly ‘chaotic’ career paths and relationships have led to macro economic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large  ‘Ironically  many of these Silicon Valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile ‘‘organizational men’’ of the 1950s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer’  Saxenian  p  28   

The independent film making industry 

Like the Silicon Valley  the independent film making industry is noted for its innovative ability  cutting edge creativity  and overall economic success  Like in the Silicon Valley  boundaryless careers are central to independent film making activities  These activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs  They superseded the former studio based model of in house film production  and its associated restrictive practices  Since the early 1970s  the new model has persisted  Boundaryless careers provide the building blocks that combine to facilitate production of the industry’s separately creative parts  Independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its in house predecessor  Jones  1996   

Several characteristics of the independent film industry favour boundarylessness  including the uncertainty in the marketplace  the limited project duration  the lack of vertical integration among industry players  and the excess supply of quality labour  The uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film  When financing is arranged  it is specifically for the purpose of completing a single project  the making of the film  The limited duration of the project is such that all resources  including human resources  are temporary  The assembled company is essentially wound down upon the film’s release  At this time  the film’s credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments  

Uncertainty over financing and limited project duration foster a ‘weak’ environment in which permanent structure is dysfunctional  Studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done  Moreover  the project based system allows for highly complex  unique ‘products’ – films – to benefit from rapid and efficient allocation and re allocation of resources  Each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are re negotiated  A ready supply of quality labour contributes to the success of the independent production model  The industry is a magnet for talented  committed workers eager for work on the industry’s terms  These include being ready to depart to remote locations at a moment’s notice  However  as with Silicon Valley high technology projects  much of the work is economically ‘clustered’  thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another  

As Jones’s  1996  research affirms  people’s social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry  At the ‘beginning’ stage  freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry  As one grip electrician explained  ‘‘‘There’s no tried and true way to get started  You have to find people you like who make movies       It’s getting the first job that is the hardest’’’  Jones  1996  p  62   Once inside  the worker at the ‘crafting’ stage finds that  ‘You build your reputation every day  You’re only as good as your last job’  pp  64–5   Reputation matters  as careers are self managed and advanced through successive ‘credits’ that span multiple  largely forgotten  temporary film making companies  

Having learned key skills and become indoctrinated into the industry culture  individuals enter a ‘navigating’ stage  furthering their reputation and developing the personal contacts that provide the resources to navigate from one project to another  In the words of one film commissioner  ‘‘‘We are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another’’’  Jones  1996  p  65   It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills  Eventually  successful careers go full circle and move to a ‘maintenance’ stage  Here  senior members of the industry identify and train new members  establish workshops that develop talent in the field  and co ordinate events such as film festivals  During this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry  

In a ‘weak’ environment that lasts a lifetime  it is critical that non bureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry  Part of this cohesion is provided by subcontractors  whose processes of selection  training  and socialisation bring boundaryless careers together in project based arrangements that provide tacit infrastructure and social familiarity  However  it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the micro level behaviour that fills the relatively structure less context  Despite the fact that no explicit rules or operating procedures exist there is much tacit communication that binds professionals together  The aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macro level cohesion  Shared understanding and related expectations  for example regarding the need for unusual working hours and the use of ‘idle’ time to teach newcomers professional skills  play a key role linking identities to workplace interactions  In the process of learning the ropes  individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career  Once socialised  people engage in collective learning as they problem solve on a project by project basis  Learning accumulates  disperses  and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment  

From micro level enactment we see macro level influence and patterns  order and shape in the independent film industry  Not only do we observe distinct stages of careers  we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour  What one can see from the pattern of progression that characterises freelance boundaryless careers in the film industry is that although few formal boundaries exist  persistent social structures and repeated patterns of interaction can be observed  In the process of enacting their careers  individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development  In this respect careers in the Silicon Valley and the film industry have much in common  with organising in film making resembling a ‘project based’ Valley  Just as careers can be traced in the Valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams  in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals micro level organising shaping macro activity  

Refinements on enactment 

Agency and communion

Both of our previous examples suggest that the enactment of boundaryless careers unfolds through a mixture of personal initiative and mutual co operation  Marshall  1989   after Bakan  1966   refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion  At a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about co operation  Agency is individualistic  and characterised by autonomy  independence  initiative  and adaptation  It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development  Communion  in contrast to agency  is concerned about connections  relationships  tolerance  and trust  It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others 1 

In ‘weak’ environments  in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled  both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty  Agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long term goals  Left to its own means  however  agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform  the balance of power to be lost  and  most importantly  the trust and co operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited  Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued  However  unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur  

The Silicon Valley and independent film making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion  Agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries  communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements  Together  the combination of behaviours supports current high technology or film making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities  This development includes community building that will influence the make up and effectiveness of future project teams  Host industries will thrive  our examples suggest  as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem  Rousseau & Arthur  1999   

Contemporary views of work frequently lament a loss of community in restructured employment arrangements  However  in calling for a return to community  these views frequently look no further than the single company  An enactment perspective suggests that communities can be much more broadly diffused  Both the Silicon Valley and film making stories demonstrate that host industries  as well as their embedded occupations  provide alternative contexts for community building to occur  Other kinds of community – stemming  for example  from shared ideological  family  educational  ethnic  or gender attachments – can also provide enduring support for people’s boundaryless career endeavours  Parker & Arthur  2000   

1	Some researchers  notably Marshall  1989   emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency  We do not do so here  although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the Silicon Valley is  in the broadest sense  ‘feminised’  

Reciprocity

A related concept is that of reciprocity  Since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time  a balance of behaviours is required  Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations  Traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards  Accordingly  deferred pension rights  vacation time  promotion opportunities  and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had ‘served their time’  In contrast  those who changed employer were handicapped by the loss of the privileges that they left behind  The Silicon Valley and film making worlds suggest a different logic  one where the old entitlement based models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments  

With boundaryless careers  employment relationships are too fluid to assume the trappings of traditional loyalty based employment systems  In the simplest case  employment arrangements reflect a ‘spot’ contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment  However  our examples suggest subtler forces are at work  People are recruited to participate in high technology and film making projects for the skills that they bring – skills that have been developed from previous projects  The system  at its best  consists of cycles in which the learning taken from previous projects is applied in the current project  which in turn provides new learning opportunities  The simple exchange of commitment to do one’s best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment  and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down  Arthur  Inkson & Pringle  1999   

The concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of project based activities  Work which provides an underlying project based structure  such as in construction  ‘jobs’   law  cases   or computing  programmes   provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur  If the benefits are genuinely mutual  projects provide a basis for high commitment from both parties to the short term employment contract  Yet  the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the project’s conclusion  Individuals can take their learning from projects and project participants with them  Meanwhile  their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company  or the host industry  or both  Ultimately  other industries can also benefit as mobile workers transport best practices to new situations  

A new continuity 

What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? Many would argue that traditional employment systems  going back to the factories of the eighteenth century  do not favour boundaryless careers  We agree  but we also live in a time when those systems are failing  and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change  Moreover  those systems were designed according to a conception of ‘labour capital’ rather than to one of ‘intellectual capital’  Yet  it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today  Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning  Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large? 

If the workforce at large can learn  what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know  or at least contribute to knowing  what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards  Williamson  1975   or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust? 

A colleague recently visited the Czech republic  and explored that country’s relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy  She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market  ‘Work for McDonalds ’ went the surprising reply  ‘but only for six months ’ It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service  After six months  the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time  from a career perspective  to move on  

The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is  writ large  the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts  Today’s work is increasingly ‘intelligent’ work  Quinn  1992   that calls on workers’ learning capacities  and – as our examples suggest – provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold  If that organising structure is lacking  the worker can heed the advice of our Czech informant and design a project for herself or himself  

In the future  we submit  most careers will be boundaryless  We have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished – reaping benefits for people  companies  and host industries alike  New theories  such as Karl Weick’s theory on the enactment of careers  can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex  self organising  social phenomena  People may not need to move between firms perpetually  but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas  As they take charge  boundaries will form and re form  and underlying order provide a macro economic stability in an environment in which ‘organization man’ has become all but extinct

Zoot Suit
A style of suit worn by African Americans  Filipino Americans  and Mexican Americans during the 1930s and 1940s  In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the 1940s  The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs  long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads  thick soled shoes  and long watch chains dangling from the belt  An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut  long with a ducktail and a wide brimmed hat 
The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem  and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style  Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing  the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders  that later became known as the zoot suit  In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison  he describes the zoot  suiters’ style  “walking slowly  their shoulders swaying  their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles  their coats long and hip tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men”  1947  380   In the late night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer diller coat with a drape shape  reat pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic’s cell”  380   Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume  which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing  The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth  and the finger tipped coat was made for fun and leisure  The long baggy pants were made for dancing  especially the jitterbug  and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood  “The business of fun  dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot Suiters  It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture”  Tyler  23   Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit  such as Cab Calloway  Sammy Davis Jr   and Duke Ellington  Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits  also known as Gone with the Wind suits  after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name 
Even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities  it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles  Pachucos were mostly second generation Mexicans  the sons of migrant laborers and working class immigrants  Pachucos created their own subculture  an arrogant style of dressing  a bilingual secret argot  and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs  The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American  It was not a bicultural or binational position  but rather a position between cultures  a “hanging in space” position  The overly confident  slow swagger of the pachuco  today exemplified by the cholo  made it appear in fact as if the zoot suiter were walking on air 
During the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city  It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked  beat  and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot suiters  Between the third and thirteenth of June zoot suiters were open targets  Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives 
During the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez  In 1981 a film by the same name  Zoot Suit  was produced and directed by Luis Valdez  with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos

Zozobra
A giant  forty foot effigy in the form of a puppet  which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe  New Mexico  The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished ” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta  which symbolizes the end of destructiveness  gloom  and worry  setting the tone for a successful fiesta  The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster  who felt that the fiesta had become “dull and commercialized ” Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty foot puppet to the elaborate forty foot figure with animated eyes  arms  and mouth that he is today  In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe  He is hung on a tall pole on a hill  outside the city  where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch  The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness 
In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra  a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee  a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman  during the Festival de Otoño

               A Physics of Semantics?
            
            
               Each of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory 
               Each is tentative and incomplete  pointing but not fully adequate 
               Yet  I persistently hope  it is better to light one candle against   what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before?
               There are grounds  reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries  to doubt a physics of semantics 
               We are on shaky ground 
               Yet when the first hard frost comes  when the birches have been swung  their crimson leaves scattered carelessly  when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn  long legged  knowing how winter is thin  when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams  small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where  perhaps  something new is to be found 
            
            
               We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent  able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady  powerful flight 
               The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom  and perhaps more than the vaunted quark 
               But autonomous agents  we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf  we to whom  intentionality  and  purpose  are so inevitably attributed by our common languages  we are  by my definition of autonomous agents  also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties 
               If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more  a properdefinition of life itself  then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where  purpose  is ascribed by all of us to one another 
            
            
               Semantics enters with purpose 
               For this to be true  it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose  say  the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient  be conscious 
            
            
               I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful  an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle  now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work  then do extract work  propagating work and constraint construction  from their environment 
            
            
               Know how
            
            
               Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now  plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material 
            
            
               I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had  individually and collectively  the embodied know how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world 
               Indeed  as I have emphasized before  a biosphere is a self consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents  ways of making a living  and the search procedures  mutation  recombination  as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents 
               Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of  jobs  that were widely filled  the abundant niches of the bio sphere 
               There is in this whole self constructing system a wider know how  beyond the know how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment 
               Yet  clearly  the know how is distributed 
               There is no autonomous agent  no one  who knows how the whole system works  any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions  deals  steals  hopes  and frustrations 
            
            
               What in the world is  know how ?
               Philosophers distinguish between  know how  and  know that  
               I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums 
                Know that  concerns propositions  most conveniently  human propositions 
               I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese 
               I know that the earth circles the sun  that the earth is roughly spherical  that chairs are used to sit on 
                Know that  brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world 
               Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can  know that  with respect to propositions 
            
            
               Unlike  know that    know how  does not involve propositions about the world 
                Know how  involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world 
               The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest  the athletic genius high jumping  have the know how to do it 
            
            
               Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world?
               I certainly want to say yes  without attributing consciousness in any way 
               Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes  metabolic switching  mechanical twitching  sensing of glucose gradient  swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations 
               It knows how all right  even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business 
               But then  try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention 
            
            
               Thank God for know how 
               Know that is a thin veneer on a four billion year old know how skill abundant in the biosphere 
               But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents  it would seem  is also graced by the selfsame know how 
               If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms  they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them 
            
            
               The know how is  in these terms  nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis  work tasks  sensing  recording  and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents 
               The know how is not outside that propagating organization 
               The know how is the propagating organization 
            
            
               Semantics
            
            
               All of which brings us  inevitably  to the brink of semantics 
            
            
               It is simple at its roots  you see 
               An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is  i  food   ii  poison   iii  a signal   iv  neutral   v  something else 
            
            
               Once there is an autonomous agent  there is a semantics from its privileged point of view 
               The incoming molecule is  yuck  or  yum  
               I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent 
               And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind 
               If yum  then there will probably be more of this type of agent  osprings of the first 
               If yuck  it is not so likely this lineage will prosper 
            
            
               Once yuck and yum  we are not far from C  S  Pierce s meaning laden semiotic triad  sign  signified  significans 
               Like it or not  the glucose gradient is a sign  a predictor  of  more glucose that way  
               Granted  the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol  any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain 
               In this restricted sense  signs are causally correlated with that which is signified 
               By contrast  the relation between the word  chair  and that which it signifies  and on which I am now sitting  is arbitrary 
               But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view?
               If so  can  mere chemicals  be signs in the full Piercean sense?
            
            
               I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words 
               Consider first the famous genetic code 
               Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein 
               The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached  the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids  the binding of the charged transfer RNA s anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet  the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm  tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is  translated  
            
            
               The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules  which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid 
               As J  Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site  the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis 
               The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site 
               Because of this  which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging  plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA 
               Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon codon matching mechanism 
               In short  chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations 
            
            
               It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign  signified  and significans to the genetic code 
               It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling  chemical and otherwise  within and between autonomous agents  as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that  warns  other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti insect secondary metabolites 
            
            
               The calculus that is Claude Shannon s elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols 
               Nowhere in the core of Shannon s work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning  or semantics  of the information enter 
               This is no criticism  and is widely known and appreciated 
               There is  however  just a hint of semantics in Shannon s view that the semantics resides in the  decoder  
            
            
               I cannot buy Shannon s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent 
               If not  then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of water filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways 
               The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding 
            
            
               But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner  that sequence of events seems laden with semantics 
               If only the bacterium could tell us   Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me?
               I ve run into that one before!
               I ducked under a boulder  and he never sensed me 
               I made it home 
               Pass me some more glucose please  Martha  
            
            
               I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories  for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and  therefore  cannot deduce that which will unfold 
               Thus  among other things  we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds 
               Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing 
               I too know the risks  including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from  intentional talk  to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question 
               But patience 
               Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold  but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk  let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound wave forms monitored and masses at space time lines as a description 
            
            
               Then let s just be naive for the moment 
               The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay  an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied know how of that agent in making a living  or failing to make a living  in its world 
               The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered  context dependent set of causal implications of the event  or signal  in question 
            
            
                For want of a nail  the shoe was lost  for want of the shoe  the horse was lost  and for want of the horse  the rider was lost   more or less  said Benjamin Franklin 
               The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context dependent set of implications of the event  or signal  in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system 
            
            
               It seems hard to ascribe purpose  in the sense of acting on its own behalf  to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga 
               Of course  there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological 
               After all  I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment  defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf  then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf 
               Now  five chapters later  it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter  energy  and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf 
               My definition is a definitional circle 
            
            
               On the other hand  while the definition is circular  like F   MA and Darwin s  natural selection  and  fitness   that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world 
               Stones and chairs are not  by my definition  autonomous agents 
               All living cells are 
               And the stunning fact directly before us  every day  is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf 
               Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest 
            
            
               In short  once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum  it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere 
            
            
               Knowing
            
            
               What about  knowing ?
            
            
               Daniel Dennett  in his fine book Darwin s Dangerous Idea   advances a hierarchy of forms of  knowing   if I may use that term  that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means 
               I find his hierarchy congenial and informative 
               Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher order entities via variation and natural selection 
            
            
               I do not disagree  although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self organization in evolution 
               Here  in Investigations   I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy  detect those sources of energy  create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy  and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further 
               I wonder  in short  at the naturalness and self generaticity of Dennett s cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres  perhaps planetary geologies  and beyond 
            
            
               But back to the past 
               Dennett distinguishes  Darwinian creatures    Pavlovian creatures    Popperian creatures   and  Gregorian creatures  
               A simple autonomous agent  say  a bacterium  is a Darwinian creature 
               In its simplest version  the creature evolves by mutation  also recombination and natural selection 
               For the moment  no behavioral learning is to be considered 
               So one  or a colony or an ecosystem  of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us 
            
            
               At the next level up  say  aplysia  a nervous system is present  and the creature is capable of stimulus response learning  á la Pavlov 
               Indeed  aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in  expectation  of food 
            
            
               At the next level  Dennett  perhaps properly  reserves this for us vertebrates  is the Popperian creature 
               Popperian creatures  in Dennett s fine phrase  have  internal models  of their world and can  run the internal model  with the clutch disengaged  rather than running the model in real time in the real world 
               This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our  hypotheses to die in our stead  
               I love that image 
            
            
               Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely  at least humans 
               Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives  arrows  digging sticks  machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes 
               This enlarged shared world gives us more know how  and more know that 
               Cultural evolution  at some point  begins to burst out of bounds 
               Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran 
               Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom?
               Chinese cooking lands in Cuba  and Cuban Chinese cuisine is invented 
               What s next under the sun?
               Who can say?
            
            
               I very much like Dennett s ladder of know how  and eventual know that 
               Without invoking consciousness  not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject  it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems  even without evoking nerve cells 
            
            
               I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations 
               For example  bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already  for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level 
               This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus  but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter 
               As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus  why not envision a complex chemistry  say  very complex carbohydrate synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves  which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism 
               Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self sustaining web linking the carbohydrates  the enzymes  and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus  then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops 
               The image is not too far from how it is imagined that  idiotype  and  anti idiotype  immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen 
               In such networks  for which there is modestly good evidence  a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences  called the  idiotype  of the first antibody 
               In turn  the second  anti idiotype  antibody stimulates a third  which stimulates a fourth 
               But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody  hence  the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space 
               It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system 
            
            
               Popperian creatures?
               Why cannot the molecular sensing and hypothesis testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor  or not  such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by?
               Are nerves necessary?
               Plants  as noted  are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade 
               There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect  just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified 
               Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates 
            
            
               I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures 
               Even here  the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language  wherever new sentences can be created  is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole 
               If the conversation we recent two legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive  so too is the chemical conversation in any full fledged ecosystem  where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another 
            
            
               I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere  with its urgent diversity in which  emboldened by all our know how  we do get on with a very rich conversation  may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks 
               We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e mail  I guess 
               Smart place  a biosphere  lots to talk about 
               Four billion years of yammering 
               Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago 
            
            
               Ethics
            
            
               And what of ethics?
               Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?
               Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent 
               There are deep reasons for caution 
               Hume told us long ago about the  naturalistic fallacy   One cannot deduce  ought  from  is  
               From the fact that mothers care for their young  we cannot deduce that they ought to do so  Hume argued 
               From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry  we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so 
            
            
               Indeed  Hume s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements 
               We scientists find the facts 
               You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics 
               But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is  where do values come from at all?
               Hume s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category  ought  
            
            
               The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long  twisted  arduous 
               Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful  philosophers as famous as G  E  Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances 
                It is wrong to kill  
               Becomes   Agggah! 
               Does the positivist argument seem persuasive?
               It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists   only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful   is itself not empirically verifiable 
               One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards 
            
            
               John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all  contractually  agree to  were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments 
               Thus  equality before the law  is one contract that Rawls commends to us 
                Equality before the law  is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium 
               The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue 
            
            
               I will content myself with wondering where  value  and the rudiments of  intentionality  come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts 
               Where is the place of value in a world of fact?
            
            
               So  a short soliloquy 
               Facts are know that statements 
               But know how preceded know that 
               While fully aware of Hume s injunction  I think that from the autonomous agent s perspective  yuck or yum is primary  unavoidable  and of the deepest importance to that agent 
               I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria 
               Too much yuck  this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere 
               Without attributing consciousness to an E  coli   or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future  I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around 
            
            
               And again without attributing consciousness  once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?
               If so  another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid 
               Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible 
               You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control 
               To act ethically  you must first be able to act at all 
            
            
               But what are  acts  in the first place?
               Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician 
               Now entering Harvard  Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive  after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard  where  at age fourteen  Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands 
               Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the  doings  of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent 
               Note we say the E  coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner 
               But all sorts of molecular vibrational  rotational  and translational motions are occurring 
               What are actions and what are mere happenings?
            
            
               I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics 
               But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings  Dan s happy phrasing  is relevant for E  coli   tigers  us  trees  and autonomous agents in general 
               We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism 
            
            
               Strange and interesting  is it not  that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?
               Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier  yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics  intentionality  value  and ethics arise with autonomous agents 
               I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume s naturalistic fallacy 
               We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context  but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents 
            
         
      
   


  
    
      
        Introduction
        The concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the
        pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  IPF  has
        recently evolved   1 2     Lung fibroblasts respond  
        in vitro   to inflammatory cytokines
        by producing growth factors and collagen  resulting in
        fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix
        deposition   2 3 4     In addition  activated lung
        fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of
        inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  
        in vitro   and hence  these cells may
        also have a role as effector inflammatory cells   1 2    
        This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic
        factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung
        fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target
        cells  via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms  perpetuating
        the fibrotic process   2    
        Prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast
        function   5 6 7 8 9     Prostaglandin  PG E 
        2 is thought to have antifibrotic
        properties 
        in vitro   but also can have
        proinflammatory effects both 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro   10 11 12     Thromboxane
         TX A 
        2 increases proliferation  and DNA and
        RNA synthesis in several cell types  including fibroblasts
        and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells   13 14
        15 16     Conversely  prostacyclin  PGI 
        2   decreases smooth muscle cell
        proliferation and collagen synthesis   17 18    
        Many cell types  including lung fibroblasts  contain
        cyclooxygenase  COX   a proximal enzyme in prostanoid
        production  and can generate prostanoids   19     It has
        been previously reported that IPF lung fibroblasts have
        decreased COX 2 expression compared to normal lung
        fibroblasts and  hence  have decreased PGE 
        2 production   12 20 21     Because of
        these findings and the fact that PGs are important
        fibroblast regulators  we sought to investigate whether
        abnormalities in COX 2 expression could be associated with
        an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic
        PGs  We hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of
        patients with IPF  HF IPF  have an altered PG balance
        compared to normal lung fibroblasts  HF NL   This
        phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in
        the pathogenesis of IPF 
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Primary lung fibroblasts
          Fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients  6 males 
          with IPF  HF IPF  were harvested  a  from excised lung at
          the time of lung transplantation  b  during an autopsy
          performed within 4 hours from death  or c  during open or
          transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis  Of
          the seven patients  five subjects had advanced lung
          fibrosis and were receiving prednisone ±
          immunosuppressive agents  2 patients were at an earlier
          stage of their disease and were not receiving
          immunosuppressive drugs  The mean age of the patients was
          59  range 43 71    HF NL were cultured from five human
          lungs that arrived at our transplant center with the
          intention of being used for transplantation  but for
          various reasons could not be transplanted  these were
          macroscopically and microscopically normal  The cells
          were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described
          by Kumar 
          et al    22     Briefly  lung
          tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and
          incubated with serum free DMEM containing trypsin  DNAse
          and collagenase for 30 min  The procedure was repeated
          twice  and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in
          one 100 mm plate and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO 
          2 humidified atmosphere  Culture
          medium  DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum  FBS  and
          penicillin streptomycin  was replaced three times per
          week and fibroblasts were passed  1 2 split  at the time
          they became confluent  On passage 4 the cells were
          resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS and DMSO and
          frozen at  70°C  For each experiment described below the
          cells were thawed  cultured and passed at least once  All
          the experiments were conducted with cells at passages 6
          to 8 
        
        
          Inducible cyclooxygenase  COX  2 expression and
          eicosanoid production
          COX 2 activity was determined by measuring PGE 
          2   6 keto PGF 
          1α  stable PGI 
          2 metabolite   TXB 
          2  stable TXA 
          2 metabolite   and PGF 
          2α production in stimulated
          fibroblasts  HF IPF  n   7  and HF NL  n   5  were
          brought to >90% confluency in 100mm plates and then
          placed on serum free DMEM for 24 hours to render them
          quiescent  Fibroblasts were then incubated in DMEM with
          5% FBS alone or in the same medium with IL 1β  2 5 ng ml 
          for 24 hours  At the end of the incubation period the
          supernatant was aspirated and fresh media containing 30
          μM of arachidonic acid was added to the plates  After 30
          min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved
          at  70°C for later eicosanoid analysis  The cells were
          then resuspended and divided into two aliquots  which
          were used for RNA and protein extractions  respectively

        Discussion
        Several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and
        collagen production  including mitogenic cytokines  e g  
        transforming growth factor β  TGFβ   platelet derived
        growth factor  PDGF   basic fibroblast growth factor
         bFGF    eicosanoids  i e   PGE 
        2   TXB 
        2   and PGI 
        2    and antifibrogenic cytokines  e g 
        IFN γ    1 2 3     It is very likely that a complex
        interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair
        process  and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis  as in
        IPF  results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts
        that affect the  normal  interaction of these factors 
        Our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of
        human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine IL 1β
        upregulates COX 2 protein and mRNA expression to a similar
        degree in normal and IPF fibroblasts  TXA 
        2 production tended to be greater in IPF
        than in normal fibroblasts at baseline  when stimulated
        with IL 1β this difference became statistically
        significant  The ratio of PGI 
        2 to TXA 
        2 metabolites was lower in IPF
        fibroblasts at baseline and with IL 1β stimulation  The
        above results suggest that a decreased PGI 
        2  TXA 
        2 ratio could be a phenotypic alteration
        present in IPF fibroblasts  resulting in a loss of their
        capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular
        matrix production 
        The effects of PGs on cell proliferation and collagen
        production have been widely studied in different cell types
          13 14 15 16 17 26     TXA 
        2 has been studied extensively because
        of its apparent role in atherosclerosis  due to its
        prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth
        muscle cells   15 16     These mitogenic effects are
        potentiated by growth factors   15 16 27 28     In vascular
        smooth muscle cells TXA 
        2 stimulates synthesis of bFGF and
        increases the expression of the proto oncogenes 
        c fos   
        c myc   and 
        egr 1   which are associated with
        entry into the cell growth cycle   15     In addition  TXA 
        2 increases proliferation of fibroblasts
          13   and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells  
        14    
        On the other hand  PGI 
        2 decreases vascular smooth muscle cell
        proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane
        synthesis  via activation of adenylyl cyclase and
        subsequent production of cAMP   17     Betaprost  an analog
        of PGI 
        2   decreases procollagen I and III mRNA
        expression in cardiac fibroblasts   18     These effects
        may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with TXA 
        2 and it is possible that an alteration
        of a  normal  physiologic balance between PGI 
        2 and TXA 
        2 could increase tendency towards
        fibrogenesis 
        It is important to mention that our experiments were
        conducted at similar passage levels  passage 6 to 8  in
        both groups  since senescence of fibroblasts is associated
        with a shift from the biosynthesis of PGI 
        2 to TXA 
        2   24 25     It is possible that the
        difference seen in our study between HF IPF and HF NL could
        result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages  HF IPF
        might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where
        fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of
        cell divisions than HF NL  obtained from nonfibrotic lungs 
        Although this is a possibility  the age related shift in PG
        production has only been shown at very high cell passages
        and has not been documented 
        in vivo  
        We also found that both HF IPF and HF NL had similar PGE
        
        2 production at baseline  and a similar
        increase when stimulated with IL 1β  PGE 
        2 can decrease fibroblast proliferation
        and collagen synthesis  and increase collagen degradation

        Recent reports suggesting decreased COX 2 expression and
        PGE 
        2 production in IPF fibroblasts have
        received significant attention   12 20 21     In our study
        we found that both COX 2 protein expression and PGE 
        2 production were upregulated to a
        similar degree in IPF and normal lung fibroblasts  We
        believe that differences in methodology and patient
        selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies 
        Vancheri and collaborators   20   found that
        TNF α stimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased
        COX 2 expression and PGE 
        2 production  but they further showed
        that these findings were a result of decreased expression
        of TNF α receptors  The latter finding would argue against
        a primary defect in COX 2 expression  since no other
        stimulus  other than TNF α  was tested  In another study 
        Keerthisingam 
        et al    21   reported that fibrotic
        lung fibroblasts had decreased COX 2 expression and PGE 
        2 production in response to TGFβ
        stimulation  This study differed from ours in that a
        different stimulus was used  Of significance is the fact
        that the COX 2 gene is known to be NF κB dependent  and
        IL 1β  but not TGFβ  is a potent inducer of NF κB
        activation  Hence  the pathway involved in the induction of
        the COX 2 gene by IL 1β and TGFβ may be different 
        Furthermore  a significant proportion of the fibroblasts
        used in the study by Keerthisingam 
        et al    21   were obtained from
        patients with systemic sclerosis  which makes their
        fibroblast population more heterogeneous 
        Wilborn 
        et al    12   also reported a
        decreased production of PGE 
        2 by IL 1β stimulated IPF fibroblasts 
        due to decreased COX 2 expression   12     There is a
        possibility that patient selection may have differed
        between the two studies  However  we feel certain that the
        diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high  due
        to the fact that 5 out of a total of 7 IPF subjects
        included in our study underwent lung transplantation with
        confirmatory pathology results consistent with IPF  The
        other 2 subjects had biopsy proven IPF  In addition  our
        results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts
        obtained from 5 subjects with advanced stage IPF with those
        of 2 subjects at an earlier stage of their disease  who had
        received no therapy  Although the reasons for our different
        results are unclear  the fact that we found similar COX 2
        expression and PGE 
        2 production in normal and IPF lung
        fibroblasts suggests that loss of COX 2 expression is not a
        universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the
        lungs of subjects with IPF 
      
      
        Conclusion
        We have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and
        IPF human lungs have a significant and similar induction of
        the COX 2 enzyme when stimulated with IL 1β  but that IPF
        fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a
        significantly lower prostacyclin thromboxane ratio  We
        hypothesize that the lower PGI 
        2  TXA 
        2 ratio seen in HF IPF may be a
        phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis
        of IPF

        There is a much quoted saying  attributed to the epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose  “A large
        number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number
        exposed to a very high risk ” This is true for many individual risk factors such as salt
        intake  linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease  and speeding on the
        highway  linked to injuries and accidents   Does it apply to many other global health
        risks? The study by Anthony Rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does 
        To develop effective health policies  one must understand the existing health risks and
        disease burdens  On a worldwide scale  this is a tough challenge  The Global Burden of
        Disease Database  maintained by the World Health Organization  WHO   collects data from
        countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco  malnutrition  childhood abuse 
        unsafe sex  childbirth  and cholesterol levels  as well as on disease burdens  for example
        depression  blindness  and diarrhea  A large group of scientists from all over the world
        has developed a framework to analyze these data  To compare different risks or burdens 
        they calculate disability adjusted life years  or DALYs—the number of healthy life years
        lost because of a particular disease or risk factor 
        Rodgers and colleagues used data from the WHO database for 26 risk factors and from 14
        epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of
        risk factor attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age 
        sex  and exposure level  For being underweight in childhood  for example—the leading risk
        factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only 35% of the disease burden
        occurred in severely underweight children  the rest occurred in those only moderately
        underweight  The relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower  but the
        number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted
        to almost two thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor 
        The analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many
        major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels  not just among
        individuals exposed to high levels of risk  It also points to risk factors that are
        particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups  and for which highly
        targeted interventions could be effective 
        Despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one  such analyses are
        essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life
        years lost to premature death and disability 
      
    
  


  
    
      
        
        Kofi Annan  the Secretary General of the United Nations  recently called attention to
        the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the
        challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the United Nations and
        the world scientific community closer to each other  Annan 2003   Mr  Annan stressed the
        importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing
        countries  asserting that “This unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates
        serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries  but for
        development itself ” Indeed  Mr  Annan s sentiments have also been echoed recently by
        several scientists  who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific
        output between the developing and already developed countries  Gibbs 1995  May 1997

        and Cultural Organization  UNESCO  estimates  UNESCO 2001  indicate that  in 1997  the
        developed countries accounted for some 84% of the global investment in scientific research
        and development  had approximately 72% of the world researchers  and produced approximately
        88% of all scientific and technical publications registered by the Science Citation Index
         SCI   North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications
        produced annually  with 36 6% and 37 5%  respectively  worldwide  UNESCO 2001  
        
          
            North America and Europe clearly dominate the number of scientific
            publications produced annually 
          
        
        It is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science
        and therefore account for the largest number of publications  It is also likely that there
        is a statistical bias on the part of the SCI as a bibliometric database  since it
        represents North American and European publications far better than those of the rest of
        the world  Gibbs 1995  May 1997  Alonso and Fernández Juricic 2001  Vohora and Vohora
        2001   But is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and
        developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing  as Mr  Annan has
        implied? A closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in
        developing countries  For example  Latin America and China  although representing 
        respectively  only 1 8% and 2% of scientific publications worldwide  have increased the
        number of their publications between 1990 and 1997 by 36% and 70%  respectively  which is a
        much higher percentage than the increments reached by Europe  10%  and industrial Asia
         26%   The percentage of global scientific publications from North America actually
        decreased by 8% over the same period  UNESCO 2001  
      
      
        Publishing Trends in the Americas
        Using the SCI databases produced by the Institute for Scientific Information  ISI   as
        well as data compiled by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología
         RICYT   we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific
        publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000 
        focusing on the Americas as a case study  Not surprisingly  there was a huge disparity in
        the number of publications from 1990 until 2000  with the United States contributing the
        lion s share  84 2%   followed by Canada  10 35%   Latin America as a whole contributed
        only 5 45% to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years  RICYT
        2002  
        The total number of publications  however  is not necessarily the best measure for
        assessing scientific productivity or technical advances  May 1997   More relevant
        measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of
        publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research
        and development  May 1997   The proportional change in the number of publications  using
        1990 as a comparison  revealed that scientific publishing in Latin America increased the
        most rapidly in the Americas  far outpacing the United States and Canada  Figure 1  
        Further analyses  correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money
        invested in research and development for each region  also show that  in contrast to both
        Canada and United States  the trend in Latin America has been an increase in relative
        output throughout the 1990s  Figure 2   Moreover  when taking into account the amount of
        research money available to researchers  Latin America actually out published the United
        States and Canada by the year 2000  Figure 2   Although the cost of research is undoubtedly
        cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries  overhead and
        other work standards  these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number
        of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in Latin America 
        particularly from 1995 until 2000  Figure 2  
        Other relative indicators of scientific productivity  such as the number of publications
        picked up by the SCI in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country  also
        demonstrate that such developing regions as Latin America are making substantial
        contributions to science  despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic
        product  GDP  invested in science in Latin America throughout this 10 year period was only
        21% of the amount invested in United States  RICYT 2002   Indeed  this scientific
        productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science
        itself as compared with the GDP of Latin America as a whole  In fact  Albornoz  2001 
        concluded that  as a group  Latin America could afford to invest a much higher proportion
        of its resources in scientific research and development  Latin American investment in
        research and development represented only 0 59% of the regional GDP in 1998  a very weak
        effort compared with that of the United States  2 84%  and Canada  1 5%  
        Among Latin American countries  there is a high degree of variability in publication
        rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology  Some countries have
        performed particularly well  For example  Uruguay  Chile  Panama  and Cuba averaged 
        respectively  6 8  5 3  5 2  and 3 4 publications per million dollars of research and
        development investment in the 10 years studied  which is notoriously high compared with
        United States  1 5  and even Canada  3 3   RICYT 2002   Other countries  such as Costa
        Rica  Cuba  Brazil  and Chile  have invested a much greater proportion of their GDP in
        research and development than the other countries of this region  Albornoz 2001  
        
          
            Why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and
            development been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in United States and
            Canada?
          
        
      
      
        Explaining the Increase in Publishing Productivity in Latin America
        One potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in Latin America
        is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries
        of this region  Indeed  this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in
        Latin America compared with the relatively flat increases in the United States and Canada 
        which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade  A potentially more
        important question  however  is why the number of publications per dollar invested in
        research and development has been increasing in Latin America while decreasing in the
        United States and Canada  This pattern could be the result of a variety of factors  none of
        which are mutually exclusive  It is possible that publishing in international journals as a
        measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in Latin America  Increased
        funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs
        might have been an important stimulus  International cooperation resulting in more
        scientific collaborations among scientists in Latin America  Europe  and the United States
        may also have increased the relative number of publications in Latin America  In contrast 
        the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in Canada and
        United States could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific
        programs 
      
      
        Scientific Impact from Latin America
        What  exactly  is the relative impact of such developing regions as Latin America on the
        scientific community? We used SCI 2001 data to examine the proportion of publications in
        the area of ecology  including the fields of evolutionary biology  conservation biology 
        and global change biology  between 1990 and 2002 in both the two top general science
        journals  
        Nature and 
        Science   with impact factors of 27 96 and 23 33  respectively  and in
        the 20 top ecological journals  with impact factors of 10 51–2 47   ISI 2001a   We credited
        a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from
        that region  Thus  more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if
        that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different
        regions 
        For the top 20 ecological journals  the American subcontinents of South  Central  and
        North America accounted for 62% of the publications worldwide  Within the Americas 
        however  Latin America represented only 6%  while Canada and United States accounted 
        respectively  for 13% and 82% of the top 20 ecological publications  When we examined the
        data as contributions to the top 10 ecological journals  impact factors 10 51–3 31  versus
        the top 11–20  impact factors 3 28–2 47   the Latin American countries contributed nearly
        twice as many publications to journals in the second category  8% in the top 11–20 compared
        with 4% in the top 10   These findings suggest that publications from such developing
        regions as Latin America are falling short of reaching the top journals  In contrast  the
        United States contributed somewhat more publications to the top 10 journals  84%  than the
        top 11–20 journals  79%   The difference in the proportion of publications contributed by
        the United States to the top 10 and top 20 journals was even more pronounced when we
        examined it in respect to worldwide publications  In this case  the United States
        contributed 60% of the publications to the top 10 journals and only 40% of the publications
        to the top 11–20 journals 
        Interestingly  the proportion of publications from Latin America  the United States  and
        Canada across all subject areas in 
        Science and 
        Nature were nearly identical to those of the top 20 ecological journals 
        In 
        Science and 
        Nature   Latin America had 7% of the publications within the Americas
        versus 6% in the top 20 ecological journals  whereas the United States and Canada had 81%
        versus 82% and 12% versus 13%  respectively  These similarities suggest that the Latin
        American researchers are not shying away from the two top ranked general science journals 
        However  publishing in 
        Science and 
        Nature was not enough to gain prominence  as evidenced by the number of
        citations of these researchers  The latest list of the 247 most cited researchers in
        ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors
        from North America  73%  and Europe  21%   ISI 2001b   No researcher working in a Latin
        American institution was included in the remaining 6%  Overall  these data indicate that
        the scientific output in the field of ecology in Latin America is having a relatively low
        impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top
        international journals  despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of
        publications per researcher funding amount  Similar findings were also reported for Asia
         Swinbanks et al  1997  and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world 
        Although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who
        independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community 
        they are the exception  Why  in general  do Latin American scientists often fail to reach
        the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields? One
        possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different
        and that the top journals  which are published in the developed world  respond more to the
        scientific mainstream of the developed regions  This is not to suggest any sort of
        conspiracy  but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is
        linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent
        journals share a similar economic region  they also share the same perception of what
        science is most interesting to them  Another consideration is that more local journals from
        developed regions are listed by the SCI than similar journals from developing regions
         Gibbs 1995   Consequently  there are more high profile regional publication opportunities
        available to scientists from the developed region  whereas much of the research published
        locally in the developing world is overlooked  But it takes more than publishing good
        papers to become a highly cited scientist  It requires attending international meetings and
        introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums  Funding these
        activities  however  requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on
        meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world 
      
      
        A Long Road Yet to Travel
        The positive trends in scientific productivity in Latin America should not be
        misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by Mr 
        Annan  There are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the
        developing world  Goldemberg 1998  Annan 2003   One is that science  as a discipline  would
        benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world  rather than being
        dominated by two geographic regions  Many scientific problems could be solved much more
        readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions 
        Climate change and biodiversity research  for example  urgently need the scientific input
        from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes  It is also
        critical for the developing world to promote  through research and publications  those
        areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon
        them  There are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations
        can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the
        industrialized world  This has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in
        Brazil  Goldemberg 1998  and biomedical sciences in Cuba  Castro Díaz Balart 2002   These
        examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world  but are also in
        themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the
        world 
        
          
            Climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific
            input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes 
          
        
        Although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before
        developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific
        community  there are also reasons to be optimistic  The relative increase in the number of
        publications  especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and
        development  demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right
        direction  The extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations  corrected
        for and despite the rather limited availability of funds  suggests that increased funding
        to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of
        publications as a measure of scientific output  particularly if these publications can
        target the journals that have the greatest impact  Although there may still be a long road
        to travel  we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by Mr  Annan are slowly being
        built 
      
    
  


  
    
      
        Background
        Glutamate decarboxylase  GAD  catalyzes the formation of
        the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ amino butyric acid  GABA 
        from glutamate  In mammals  the two isoforms of this
        enzyme  GAD67 and GAD65  are expressed from two separate
        genes  
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 respectively   1  2  3   GABA
        signaling plays several roles in neuronal development 
        Early in CNS development  GABA can modulate neuron
        progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration 
        survival and differentiation   4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 
        12  13  14   In some classes of neural progenitors GABA
        stimulates these processes while in others it has an
        antagonistic activity  For example  recent work has
        demonstrated that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to
        stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the
        ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of
        progenitors in the subventricular zone   14   Later  during
        postnatal development  normal GABAergic input is required
        for activity dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as
        shown in the 
        Gad2 knockout mouse   15  16   In
        addition to these functions in the developing CNS  GABA
        signaling is also required for the normal development of
        non neural tissues  Targeted mutations of the 
        Gad1 gene lead to defective
        development of the secondary palate   17  18   The cleft
        palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement
        of GABA mediated signals in the normal development and
        differentiation of a structure derived from the oral
        epithelium and neural crest ecto mesenchyme  This
        conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate
        defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in
        the β3 subunit of the GABA 
        A receptor   19  20  21  22  
        This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for
        GABA mediated signaling in the development of a non neural
        structure  the secondary palate  The potential for this
        pathway to be involved in the early development of
        additional non neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly
        explored   23   To address this question  we surveyed 
        Gad1 transcript distribution in the
        non CNS tissues of the embryo  Using a whole mount 
        in situ hybridization approach  we
        found that 
        Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number
        of different regions and tissues  A notable feature of this
        expression pattern is that 
        Gad1 transcripts accumulate in the
        specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the
        formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth 
        These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be
        sources of developmental signals   24  25  26   In
        addition  transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem
        cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal
        endoderm and mesenchyme  The expression patterns show that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several non CNS
        structures that are derived from each of the three germ
        layers of the embryo 
      
      
        Results
        The mouse 
        Gad1 gene is widely expressed in the
        embryonic central nervous system   27   To define
        additional sites of expression outside of the CNS  we
        analyzed the distribution of 
        Gad1 transcripts in E8 5 to E14 5
        mouse embryos by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization 
        
        Gad1 transcripts were not detected in
        E8 5 day embryos  data not shown   At E9 0 
        Gad1 was readily detected in the
        tailbud  figure 1A   Expression in the tail continued
        through E12 5 and was undetectable by E13 5  figure
        1B C Dand data not shown   a period corresponding to
        secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo   28  
        Examination of sections from an E9 5 embryo revealed a high
        level of 
        Gad1 expression throughout the
        mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of
        the tailbud  figure 1F   No transcripts were detected in
        the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme
         figure 1F   At more cranial levels within the tail 
        expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm  ventral
        neural tube  notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut
         figure 1E   In the paraxial mesoderm  the highest
        expression levels were also localized ventrally  adjacent
        to the notochord  figure 1E  
        In the pharyngeal region of E9 5 embryos  
        Gad1 RNA was detected in and around
        the second  third and fourth pharyngeal pouches  figure
        2A   Sections through the third pouch confirmed the
        presence of 
        Gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm
         data not shown   Expression was particularly strong in the
        dorsal portion of this pouch  figure 2B   The additional
        diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal
        mesenchyme  figure 2B   The expression in the pharyngeal
        region was very transient  transcripts were easily detected
        at E9 5  but only faintly at E9 0 and were not detectable
        by E10 5 
        In the limb buds  
        Gad1 RNA was detected from E9 0 to
        E11 5  figure 3A B C D E F G H   Transcripts were initially
        expressed in the pre apical ectodermal ridge  pre AER  at
        E9 5  figure 3A B  and by E10 5 were seen in the definitive
        AER of the forelimb  figure 3D   At E10 5 
        Gad1 was expressed in a diffuse
        stripe in the forelimb  figure 3D  while in the hindlimb
        expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm  figure
        3E   By E11 5 forelimb AER expression was fading and
        expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal
        forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb
         figure 3G H   The earlier activation of 
        Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the
        normal temporal order of events in limb development 
        Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds
        was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme  data not
        shown   
        Gad1 RNA was not detected in the
        limbs by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization after
        E11 5 
        A dynamic pattern of 
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        developing vibrissae from E12 5 to E14 5  figure
        4A B C D E F G H   Expression was first detected in the
        supra orbital  infra orbital  and post oral vibrissae and
        in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and
        maxillary rows  figure 4A B  nomenclature as in   29    
        Gad1 RNA was also detected in some of
        the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage  Expression
        was activated in a posterior to anterior  towards the nose 
        progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows 
        reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development   29   By
        E13 5  
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated
        in the rhinal  labial and submental vibrissae  figure
        4C D   By E14 5  expression was strong in the labial 
        submental and rhinal vibrissae  figure 4E F   Sections of
        E12 5 whole mounts show that 
        Gad1 expression was localized to the
        epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae  figure 4G H 
        and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate
         figure 4G  
        Control hybridizations using a sense strand 
        Gad1 probe were also performed 
        Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any
        staining pattern at any of the stages tested  E8 5  E14 5  
        Sense strand hybridization results for E10 5 and E11 5

        Discussion
        The expression results reported here show that 
        Gad1 was activated in several tissues
        outside of the central nervous system during mouse
        development  Transcripts were not seen at E8 5 and were
        first detected at E9 0  It was surprising that this very
        early phase of 
        Gad1 expression was largely outside
        of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud
        mesenchyme and in the pre apical ectodermal ridge  pre AER 
        of the forelimb bud  As development proceeded 
        Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal
        endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae 
        The data demonstrate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several sites
        outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all
        three germ layers  We have also detected the expression of 
        Gad1 lacZ transgenes in the
        developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and
        surprising 
        in situ hybridization results we
        report here  J J  Westmoreland and B G C   unpublished
        results  
        Previous studies have shown that 
        Gad1 can be regulated at the
        post transcriptional and translational level  
        Gad1 mRNA translation or protein
        stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level
        of GABA   30  31   During embryogenesis 
        post transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative
        splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice  
        32  33   This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop
        codon into the 
        Gad1 mRNA and can produce the
        truncated proteins  GAD25 and GAD44  from its 5   and 3 
        ends respectively  The studies reported here used a probe
        that will detect the adult 
        Gad1 mRNA that encodes GAD67 as well
        as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode
        GAD25 and GAD44  These additional mechanisms of 
        Gad1 regulation may control the
        production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the
        non neural cell types detected in our study 
        The whole mount 
        in situ hybridization data reported
        here extends the results of a recently published section 
        in situ hybridization study on
        E10 5 E12 5 mouse embryos   27   Our analysis showed that 
        Gad1 expression is first detectable
        earlier at E9 0 and revealed novel non CNS sites of
        expression in the pharyngeal region  vibrissae  tail bud
        and limb bud  The results of the previous study   27  
        together with the data reported herein  provide a
        comprehensive picture of 
        Gad1 expression in the E9 0 E12 5
        mouse embryo 
        Previous studies have noted 
        Gad expression outside of the CNS  In
        adults 
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 have been detected in a number
        of tissues including kidney  testis  oviduct  pancreatic
        islets and adrenal cortex   34  35  36  37   Previously
        reported sites of embryonic 
        Gad1 expression outside of the brain
        and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens
        fibers and the olfactory pit   38  39   In E10 5 E12 5
        mouse embryos 
        Gad1 is expressed in the olfactory
        and the lens placodes  the anlagen of the olfactory pit and
        lens fibers   27   We also detected 
        Gad1 expression in these tissues
         please see figure 3Aand data not shown   Expression of 
        Gad in the developing heart and blood
        vessels has also been reported   27   We detected weak
        staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel
        expression  perhaps due to the very low levels of
        expression in developing vasculature   27   Our results
        document localized expression of 
        Gad1 at additional non CNS sites in
        the mouse embryo  suggesting a potential role for GABA
        signaling in the development of these structures 
        Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing
        tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from
        the cleft palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 and the β3 GABA 
        A receptor subunit mutants   17  18  19 
        21  22   The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts
        through GABA 
        A receptors to modulate the development
        of this tissue  Although the data reported here do not
        explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype  they do
        indicate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several
        additional non CNS tissues in the mouse embryo  It is
        particularly noteworthy that these include the AER of the
        limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae 
        Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of
        developmental signals required for morphogenesis and
        patterning   24  25  26  40   It will be of interest to
        examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the
        mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers 
        Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues
        would indicate that these receptors read the developmental
        signals mediated by GABA in these structures and
        tissues 
      
      
        Conclusions
        The mouse gene encoding the 67 kDa isoform of glutamate
        decarboxylase   
        Gad1   is expressed in the tail bud
        mesenchyme  vibrissal placodes  pharyngeal arches and
        pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge  AER   mesenchyme
        and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from
        E9 0 E14 5  Some of the 
        Gad1 expressing tissues  vibrissal
        placodes  AER  are known sources of developmental signals 
        Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell
        populations that give rise to multiple differentiated
        tissues  tail bud mesenchyme  pharyngeal endoderm and
        mesenchyme   The localized and dynamic expression pattern
        of 
        Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD
        and GABA in the development of non neural tissues than was
        previously known

        on Swiss Webster embryos as described   41  42   The
        morning that the vaginal plug was found was considered 0 5
        days of gestation  The 
        Gad1 probe was derived from an EST

        Background
        Ecto Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases
         E NTPDases  formerly called ecto ATPases  hydrolyze
        nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are
        insensitive to inhibitors of P type  F type  and V type
        ATPases   1     Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of
        ATPase ADPase activity are present on the cell surface   2
            E NTPDase1 with a ratio of 1  E NTPDase2 with a ratio
        of 10 and E NTPDase3 with a ratio of 3 5  NTPDases are
        important in many physiological processes like cell
        motility  adhesion  nonsynaptic information transfer 
        secretion  regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases   1    
        Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will
        help description of their physiological functions  and
        development of strategies to regulate the functions of the
        enzymes 
        The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known even
        though some basic facts of the catalysis have been
        established  NTPDases do not form phosphorylated
        intermediates during catalysis  a conclusion also supported
        by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition  
        3 4 5 6     The catalytic reaction appears to be
        irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed  
        7 8     Divalent cations like Ca 2 or Mg 2 are required for
        activity  and maximal activity is reached when the
        concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal
          1     The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a
        broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to
        less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto ATPase
          9 10     Sequence comparisons indicate that most of
        NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions  apyrase
        conserved region  ACR1   ACR5   9 11     However  the
        catalytic sites have not been identified  although ACR1 and
        ACR4 have been implicated in β  and γ phosphate binding 
        respectively   9    
        E NTPDase1 is also called CD39  as it was first
        described as an antigen present on activated B and T
        lymphocytes  Residues of ACR1 to ACR5 of CD39 have been
        mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in
        catalysis  E174 in ACR3 and S218 in ACR4 are required for
        catalytic function   12     Substitution of H59 in ACR1
        converted CD39 into an ADPase in a quaternary structure
        dependent manner   13     Mutation of W187A in ACR3
        affected CD39 folding and translocation  while mutation of
        W459A in ACR5 increased ATPase activity but diminished
        ADPase activity   14     Mutations of D62 and G64 of ACR1
        and D219 and G221 of ACR4 demonstrated that the nucleotide
        phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those
        present in the actin heat shock protein sugar kinase
        superfamily   15     These results suggest that the
        conserved residues of the ACR1 to 5 regions are involved in
        the catalytic mechanism of CD39 
        The catalytic activity of CD39 is dependent on the
        presence of divalent cations  Since the interactions of Ca
         2and Mg  2with proteins are difficult to study due to the
        lack of spectroscopic properties  vanadyl  V IV O  2 has
        been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg 2   Ca
        2   and Mn 2 binding sites of several proteins  including
        carboxypeptidase   16     S adenosylmethionine synthetase  
        17 18     pyruvate kinase   19 20     and F 
        1  ATPase   21 22     This cation
        specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of
        several enzymes  and in many cases serves as a functional
        cofactor   23     Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial
        coordination sites relative to the axis of the
        double bounded oxygen  an arrangement that is similar to
        that for Ca 2 and Mg 2   As it is known that the 
        A and 
        g tensors derived from the EPR spectrum
        of bound VO 2 are a direct measure of the nature of the
        equatorial metal ligands   24     binding of VO 2 to CD39
        could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of
        CD39 
        Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble CD39 
        capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP  was expressed and
        purified from insect cells   25     Only one
        nucleotide binding site was identified on the purified
        soluble CD39 in the presence of Ca 2 when non hydrolysable
        nucleotide analogs were used  In this report  we
        characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO
        2 when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the
        purified soluble CD39  The possible metal ligands for VO
         2at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic
        mechanism is discussed 
      
      
        Results
        
          Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD39 with
          VO 2 as cofactor
          The ability of purified soluble CD39 to hydrolyze VO
          2 ATP is shown in Figure 1  Soluble CD39 did not
          hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO 2  Fig 
          1A   When VO 2 was mixed with ATP at a ratio of 1 1  the
          concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased and ATP
          decreased as the incubation time was prolonged  Fig  1B  
          The ATPase activity of sCD39 with VO 2 was about 25% of
          that with Ca 2 as a cofactor  Vanadyl is unstable in
          aqueous solution at pH7 0 in the absence of chelator and
          will precipitate out of solution as  VO OH  
          2   
          n   The rate of precipitation depends
          on the abundance and affinity of the chelator  This means
          that the actual VO 2 concentration was lower than 0 5 mM 
          This result indicates that VO 2 can functionally
          substitute for Ca 2 as cofactor for sCD39 nucleotidase
          activity 
        
        
          Characterization of bound VO 2 ADPNP by
          CW EPR
          The parallel features of CW EPR spectrum of bound VO
          2 in the presence of ADPNP  an ATP analog  are shown in
          Figure 2a  This spectrum shows 51V hyperfine splitting
          and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules
          with the V O bond oriented along the magnetic field  A 
          ||   g 
          ||   which are strong enough to tell
          the nature of VO 2 equatorial ligands   22     Of the
          eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented
          molecules  the  7 2

          ||   and  7 2 
          || transitions  shown in the figures
          from left to right  respectively  do not overlap with
          perpendicular transitions  The 51V hyperfine splitting
          spectra from molecules with V O bond perpendicular to the
          magnetic field  A⊥  are much smaller and not shown here  
          21     The intensity of  5 2 
          || peak is used as direct measurement
          of the amount of bound VO 2   since this peak is the most
          intense peak in the EPR spectrum that contains
          contribution only from A 
          || but not A⊥   21 26     In this
          study  the intensities of each bound VO 2  EPR feature
          were normalized to 1 mg of protein 
          VO 2 bound as the VO 2  AMPPNP complex to sCD39
          produced a strong spectrum characterized by A 
          || of 504 25 MHz and g 
          || of 1 9410  Fig  2b   called species
          T  Table 1   The best fit of EPR species T to eq 1 is one
          equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three
          equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate
          groups  Table 2   This result is consistent with AMPPNP
          binding strongly to a single site on sCD39 in the
          presence of metal   25    
        
        
          Characterization of EPR species from VO 2  AMPCP
          bound to sCD39
          Figure 3ashows the parallel features of the EPR
          spectrum of sCD39 bound VO 2  AMPCP  Two sets of parallel
          transitions were observed  and the derived A 
          || and g 
          || values are listed in Table 1  One
          set had A 
          || of 521 78 MHz and g 
          || of 1 937  which is defined as
          species D1  Fig  3b   The other set displayed A 
          || of 490 01 MHz and g 
          || of 1 9435  which is called species
          D2  Fig  3c   The intensity of species D1 accounted for
          11 4% of species T from bound VO 2  AMPPNP  and the
          intensity of D2 accounted for 7 1% of species T  The
          intensity ratio of species D1 over D2 was 1 6 
          In order to distinguish species D1 from D2  the sample
          with VO 2  AMPCP bound to sCD39 was thawed and incubated
          at room temperature for 30 minutes  and the VO 2 EPR
          spectrum was collected again  As shown in Figure 4aand
          4b  either A 
          || or g 
          || values for both species D1 and D2
          were changed  The intensity of species D1 was not changed
          as it accounted for 12 1% of the intensity of species T
          of the bound VO 2  AMPPNP  However  the intensity of
          species D2 was decreased dramatically  and it accounted
          for only 0 1% of the intensity of species T  The
          intensity ratio of D1 over D2 increased about 75 fold to
          become 120 
          There are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit
          well the EPR species D1 according to Eq 1  Table 2   One
          set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water
          molecules  one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or
          phosphate  and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino
          group  The other set contains one equatorial oxygen from
          water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups
          or phosphate  The best fit for the EPR species D2 to eq 1
          is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three
          equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate 
        
        
          EPR characteristics of sCD39 bound VO 2  ATP
          In order to capture the bound VO 2  EPR signal before
          the enzyme completely turned over  sCD39 and VO 2  ATP
          were mixed on ice  immediately transferred into the EPR
          tube and frozen  The entire process took about 15
          seconds  The parallel portion of the collected VO 2  EPR
          spectrum is shown in Figure 5a  VO 2  ATP complex bound
          to sCD39 produced an EPR spectrum with A 
          || of 489 5 MHz and g 
          || of 1 9455  which corresponded to
          species D2  Fig  5b   The signal intensity from the bound
          VO 2  nucleotide complex accounted only for 7 5% of that
          of species T from bound non hydrolysable VO 2  ADPNP
          complex 
          The same sample made from mixing VO 2  ATP and sCD39
          was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes  then
          the VO 2  EPR spectrum was generated as shown in Figures
          4cand 4d  The EPR parameters derived from this VO 2  EPR
          spectrum were 489 5 MHz for A 
          || and 1 9455 for g 
          || respectively  which is consistent
          with species D2  However  the signal intensity decreased
          about 37 5 fold compared to that obtained before room
          temperature incubation

        Discussion
        Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups
        that serve as metal ligands in F 
        1  ATPase and other enzymes   16 18 19
        21   because the g and A tensors of the 51V hyperfine
        couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors
        from each type of group that contributes an equatorial
        ligand   24 27     By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO
        2 in the presence of different nucleotides  we show that
        the interaction of soluble CD39 with ATP is different from
        that with ADP 
        It is not surprising that VO 2 can functionally replace
        Ca 2 in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD39 
        although the enzymatic activity is about 25% of that with
        Ca 2 as the cofactor  since F 
        1  ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a
        decreased rate when VO 2 replaces Mg 2    21    
        The EPR features of VO 2 are able to reveal some details
        about how CD39 hydrolyzes ATP and ADP  A single EPR
        feature  species T  was observed when ADPNP  a
        non hydrolyzable analog of ATP  complexed with VO 2 was
        bound to sCD39  which is consistent with the presence of
        only one nucleotide binding site   25     The g and A
        tensors derived from species T are 1 9410 and 504 25 MHz
        respectively  which can be fitted best with one amino group
        and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate
        groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO 2 on
        sCD39  In accordance with metal ATP complex coordination on
        other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP  like F 
        1  ATPase   22 28     the γ  and
        β phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO 2 while the third
        carboxyl group is contributed by a side chain of aspartate
        or glutamate of sCD39  It is not unusual for the ε amino
        group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes  It
        has been reported that the amino group serves as one of VO
        2 equatorial ligands in CF 
        1  ATPase   21     pyruvate kinase   19
        20     AdoMet synthetase   17 18     and carboxypeptidase  
        16     Thus one amino group from lysine  one carboxyl group
        from aspartate or glutamate  and two oxygens from the
        phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of
        sCD39 bound VO 2 in the presence of ADPNP 
        In the presence of AMPCP  bound VO 2 produced two EPR
        features  species D1 and species D2 that are separated by
        about 30 MHz  As we have reported that sCD39 releases
        intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP
        hydrolysis   25     sCD39 probably has two conformations
        that bind metal ADP complexes  one is the conformation that
        releases the ADP intermediate  and another that recruits
        intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis
        to AMP  However  intact CD39 does not release intermediate
        ADP during ATP hydrolysis  suggesting that there is only
        one ADP binding site on each CD39 monomer in the intact
        protein   2 25     The two EPR species observed with VO
        2  AMPCP probably correspond to the two different
        conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on
        sCD39  The signal intensity of the bound VO 2  AMPCP EPR
        spectrum indicates that species D1 is dominant over species
        D2  In order to further assign species D1 and D2 to the two
        different conformations  two experiments were done  Fig 
        5   Incubation of sCD39 with VO 2  AMPCP at room
        temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the
        intensity of species D2  while the signal intensity of
        species D1 remained unchanged  These data indicate that VO
        2  AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding
        to species D2  however  the conformation corresponding to
        species D1 still had bound VO 2  AMPCP  More evidence for
        two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR
        spectra of bound VO 2  ATP  No species T was found
        presumably because ATP was converted to ADP before the
        sample was frozen  Only species D2 was observed and its
        intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged 
        We suggest that species D2 corresponds to the conformation
        that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D1
        corresponds to the conformation that binds ADP as a
        substrate  The lower signal intensities of species D1 and
        D2 compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity
        of sCD39 for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for
        the ATP analog ADPNP  which is consistent with the result
        that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD39   25    
        The calculated g 
        || and A 
        || values that best matched the
        experimental values for species D2 suggest that one
        hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl
        groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound
        VO 2  ADP  Since the conformation corresponding to species
        D2 is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the
        conformation that releases bound VO  2 ADP  it is likely
        that the VO  2ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl
        groups   25     When ADP is the substrate and generates
        species D1  one water molecule and a combination of three
        groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the
        equatorial ligands of bound VO 2 on sCD39  The probable
        combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species
        D1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO
        2 complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO 2  ADP is
        bound to the enzyme 
        The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD39 and other
        members of the CD39 family give some hints about the
        possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the
        catalytic site of sCD39  The changes of D62 on ACR1  E174
        on ACR3  D213  D219 in HB6  and S218 on ACR4 dramatically
        decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD39   12 15
            Figure 7summarizes the possible coordination of Ca
        2 from the data of species T  species D1  and species D2 in
        the different situations of sCD39 catalysis  The catalytic
        base attack results in cleavage of the γ phosphate of ATP 
        and one carboxyl group replaces the γ phosphate as a metal
        ligand  from species T to species D2   which is accompanied
        by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group  S218?  
        This hydroxyl group  S218?  probably interacts with the
        water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation
        corresponding to species D1 to hydrolyze ADP  The constant
        carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD39
        hydrolysis is likely contributed by D213 since it is close
        to S218 
        The results presented here also provide an explanation
        to the free metal inhibition of CD39 catalytic activity 
        Free VO 2 binds to sCD39 through two hydroxyl groups and
        two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other
        residues of sCD39  Once free VO 2 occupies the catalytic
        site  the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct
        the conformation before the substrates are recruited
        properly 
      
      
        Conclusions
        VO 2 can functionally substitute for Ca 2 as a cofactor
        for sCD39  Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO
        2 bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the
        absence of nucleotide  The protein ligands for VO  2in the
        presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino
        groups  while those in the presence of ADP are probably
        carboxyl and hydroxyl groups  The mechanism of sCD
        catalysis is discussed  These results will provide guides
        for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of
        NTPDases

        Background
        Primary Sjögren s syndrome  1°SS  is a systemic
        autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes
         keratoconjunctivitis sicca   dry mouth  xerostomia  as
        well as involvement of other exocrine glands  While 1°SS is
        typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy  the
        immune destruction can often extend to affect non exocrine
        organs  Around 25 % of patients with 1°SS can present with
        involvement of other organs such as the thyroid  central
        nervous system  lungs  kidney and liver  The association of
        liver disease and 1°SS was suggested more than 40 years ago
          1     While liver involvement in 1°SS has been considered
         rare    2   only a few clinical studies specifically
        address this complication and evaluate the association of
        liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of
        1°SS   3 4 5 6    
        Liver diseases associated with 1°SS include primary
        biliary cirrhosis  PBC  autoimmune cholangitis   8 9 10    
        autoimmune hepatitis   5 6     viral hepatitis  B and C   
        11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21     sclerosing cholangitis
          22     and nodular regenerative hyperplasia   23     In
        addition  chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found
        in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis   16 17
        18 19 20 21 22 23 24    
        We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to
        determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests
         LFTs  and liver disease in patients with 1°SS referred to
        a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs
        with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of
        1°SS 
      
      
        Methods
        
          Statistical analysis
          The statistical analysis included descriptive measures
           means  standard deviations and ranges   Comparison of
          results of patients with and without liver disease was
          done using t tests of continuous variables and Fisher s
          exact test or x2 for categoric measures 
        
      
      
        Results
        Of the 115 charts reviewed  73 cases  55 women and 18
        men  median age 53  fulfilled EECC for 1°SS and were
        initially included for analysis  Of the 73 patients  a 54%
        of them  40 patients  have had a salivary gland biopsy
        performed  In all these patients  the biopsy confirmed the
        diagnosis of Sjögren s syndrome  All patients studied had
        objective evidence of 1°SS  including keratoconjunctivitis
        sicca  positive labial salivary gland biopsy 
        autoantibodies and or salivary gland hypofunction  We
        excluded those patients without these objective criteria of
        1°SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria 
        The mean age at time of onset of disease was 45 ± 20 5
        years old and disease duration was 4 9 years ± 4 5 years
         mean ± range   Liver function tests had been determined in
        59 patients  80 8 %  and abnormal liver function tests were
        found in 29 of the 59 patients  49 1 %   Further analysis
        was then undertaken in those patients in whom LFTs had been
        measured  The clinical and laboratory characteristics of
        these patients are shown in Tables 2and 3 
        For these SS patients studied  abnormal LFTs were more
        common than any other potential non exocrine features of
        SS  Clinical evidence of liver disease  defined in methods
        section  was found in 12 patients  20 3%   all of whom had
        abnormal liver function tests  Two deaths occurred in the
        population studied  both attributed to liver failure  An
        additional patient required a liver transplant  In all
        cases  the diagnosis of 1°SS antedated the onset of liver
        disease or its diagnosis  Markers of viral hepatitis 
        sought in 39 patients  were found only in 4  Two patients
        carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and one
        had antibodies to hepatitis C virus  In a liver biopsy of a
        patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis
        viruses  hepatitis B virus was detected by 
        in situ hybridization 
        Risk factors for liver disease were identified in 40% of
        the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are
        described in Table 4  No association with tobacco use was
        found  Only 5 patients had documented evidence of tobacco
        consumption  We found no significant differences in risk
        factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients
        with or without hepatic involvement  Therefore  in 60% of
        the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of
        liver disease  no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs
        was found  except for the association with 1°SS 
        The pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was
        mainly hepatocellular  defined as predominant increase of
        AST and or ALT in comparison with AP and or bilirubins  in
        11 cases  cholestatic  defined as predominant increase in
        AP and or bilirubins compared with AST and or ALT  in 3 and
        mixed  evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular
        damage  in 8 cases  Abnormalities were persistent  present
        on every occasion when measured more than once  in 19
        patients  65 5% of those with abnormal LFTs   intermittent
         presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all
        determinations  in 9  31%  and in one case  3 5%  there was
        only one determination of liver function tests  The pattern
        of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in Figure 1  None of
        the patients with abnormal liver function tests had
        clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain
        the high levels of amino transferases  Activity of CPK or
        aldolase was not elevated when measured in 15 of the 29
        patients with abnormal liver function tests 
        Anti mitochondrial antibodies  AMA  and anti smooth muscle
        antibodies  ASMA  were sought in 5 patients  with positive
        ASMA in 2 
        The association of abnormal liver function tests with
        other non exocrine features of 1°SS is shown in Figure 2 
        Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more
        likely to have lung  kidney or hematological
        manifestations  when compared to Sjögren s patients without
        liver disease  Presence of other non exocrine features of
        1°SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver
        diseases 
        Regarding laboratory test results  patients with liver
        disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation
        rate at some point during the course of their disease  A
        positive anti ENA  anti Ro  anti Ro La  and or anti RNP 
        was also associated with an increased prevalence of
        abnormal liver function tests  Figure 3   The sample was
        too small to determine whether a specific ENA was
        associated with liver disease  Other markers of systemic
        inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the
        presence or absence of LFT abnormalities 
        Liver biopsies  done in 8 patients  disclosed post viral
        chronic active hepatitis  3   cryptogenic cirrhosis  2  
        and one case each of post viral cirrhosis  alcoholic
        hepatitis  and autoimmune hepatitis 
      
      
        Discussion
        In this group of Sjögren s patients seen at a tertiary
        care center  abnormal liver function tests were found to be
        a common non exocrine feature of 1°SS  The prevalence of
        this association was found to be higher in our study than
        in other previous series   2 3 4 5 6 7     The true
        prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles
        were not done in all patients  The prevalence suggested in
        previous reports ranges from 6 to 58 %  but the definition
        of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific  e g 
        hepatomegaly  to well proven cases of liver disease   1 2 3
        4 5 6 7 28     Denko in 1960 reported that 12% of patients
        with SS had hepatosplenomegaly   29     Other studies done
        in the 1960 s also confirmed hepatomegaly in 18 20% of
        patients with SS   30 31     In 1970  Whaley reported liver
        disease in 6% of patients with SS and mentioned an
        association with anti mitochondrial antibodies   2     In
        1986  Tsianos and co workers described 22 SS patients with
        gastrointestinal complications  called from a large cohort 
        only two patients had liver disease  each with chronic
        active hepatitis   4     Other studies have reported
        variable prevalence   3 28   and different
        histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from
        cholestatic liver damage  stage I primary biliary
        cirrhosis  to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C
        virus 
        In our study  liver disease was associated with other
        non exocrine manifestations of 1°SS  specifically those
        affecting lung  kidney and blood cells  Those patients with
        serological evidence of systemic inflammation  as shown by
        an elevated sedimentation rate  were more likely to have
        liver test abnormalities  Also  the presence of a positive
        anti ENA correlated positively with hepatic disease  An
        association of ENA response with liver disease has been
        described in children with autoimmune hepatitis  where
        anti ENA positive patients demonstrated more severe liver
        test abnormalities than those who were anti ENA negative  
        32     In another study  a 15 % of patients with various
        chronic liver diseases were found to be anti RNP positive  
        33    
        With etiopathogenesis of 1°SS still an open question  
        34     a possible role of hepatitis C virus  HCV  has drawn
        attention  Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in
        patients with 1SS ranging from 14 19%   11 12 16 18 21    
        Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands
        with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis C
        virus infection and or 1°SS has given conflicting results  
        14 15   Some reports mention that the salivary gland
        findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver
        disease associated with HCV infection than in those with
        1°SS   12     while others mention distinctive differences
        between both groups regarding focus score  expression of
        surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary
        glands and in epithelial cells  as well as differences in
        the degree of inflammation   14 15     Transgenic mice
        models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an
        exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands   19
            Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ
        between HCV infection and 1°SS  Positive ENAs are rarely
        seen in HCV patients  Also  in most cases sicca symptoms
        are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with
        the 1°SS population  Although the prevalence of viral
        hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver
        disease was very low and did not account for most of the
        cases with abnormal liver function tests  these markers
        were not sought in a small percentage of these patients  It
        is important to note that HCV appears to account for a
        subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half
        the cases might meet the definition for SS according to
        European and Manthorpe criteria  However  this subgroup is
        characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations
        observed in 1°SS  and the absence of anti Ro and anti La  
        35    
        An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and
        different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a
        mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in 1° SS
          36     Since it has been suggested that the target tissue
        involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of 1°SS
        might be the epithelium   37     it is interesting that the
        findings in our study point to the association of liver
        disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities  all which
        are characterized by epithelial damage   38 39    
        Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active
        participants rather than passive targets in the chronic
        immune response in 1°SS but further studies are needed to
        establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the
        pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease  including
        the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion
        pattern in these cells 
        The co existence of liver disease and the presence of
        circulating AMAs in Sjögren s patients sera has been
        pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be
        autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis
          4 7 8 10     In previous studies  a pericholangial
        lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I
        of primary biliary cirrhosis  has been reported in 1°SS
        with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA  
        4 7     In our review of cases  we found predominance in
        hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic
        disease  which would argue against a PBC type of liver
        damage  Other authors had proposed that SS associated with
        PBC should be considered a form of secondary SS that
        resembles more the  sicca complex  with exocrine features
        seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis   40 41    
        Limitations of the study come primarily from being a
        retrospective analysis  Since the patients were studied in
        a tertiary care referral center  the severity of the
        disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be
        different from the general 1°SS population  Furthermore  in
        many cases  Sjögren s syndrome diagnosis had been sought
        because of otherwise unexplained non exocrine features 
        While we could not find an association between use of
        NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver
        function tests abnormalities  the study design did not
        allow us to exclude the possibility of over the counter
         OTC  medication use that could have affected LFT s
        measurement  Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor
        to be considered  However  given that most patients had
        persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs
        and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in
        the majority of patients with liver abnormalities  a toxic
        effect of medications could not be established 
      
      
        Conclusions
        Based on the results of this study  we consider that an
        evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver
        disease should be done in every patient with 1°SS 
        particularly if there is evidence of other non exocrine
        complications or serological evidence of systemic
        inflammation  Although no other diagnosis explaining liver
        disease may be found  the disorders for which treatment
        might be beneficial  e g  immunosuppressants for autoimmune
        hepatitis  interferon alpha for viral hepatitis 
        ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis  warrant
        a diligent search in all cases of 1°SS with abnormal liver
        function

        The problem
        Three published   1 2 3   and one recently presented   4
          randomized placebo controlled clinical trial have
        unequivocally demonstrated that 3 Hydroxy 3 methylgluatryl
        coenzyme A  HMG CoA  reductase inhibitors  statins  reduce
        the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary
        disease  These trials found that when compared with
        placebo  statins significantly reduced the incidence of
        death  myocardial infarction  unstable angina  percutaneous
        and surgical coronary revascularization  and stroke in
        persons with 
        stable coronary disease  Because
        patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome
        within three to six months of enrollment were excluded 
        these trials did not assess the effect of lipid lowering
        therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with
        recently 
        unstable coronary disease  Whether
        lipid lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if
        initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome
        is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse
        cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable
        coronary disease than in the stable setting  The Myocardial
        Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering
         MIRACL  trial set out to answer this question 
      
      
        The answer?
        MIRACL enrolled 3 086 patients within 24 96 hours  mean
        63 hours  of admission for unstable angina or a non Q wave
        myocardial infarction and randomized them to 16 weeks of
        atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo once daily   5     The major
        exclusion criteria were  total cholesterol level greater
        than 270 mg dL  Q wave myocardial infarction on admission
        or during the previous month  and  coronary
        revascularization in the months before admission  during
        the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital
        discharge  The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of
        death  non fatal myocardial infarction  resuscitated sudden
        cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening
        symptomatic myocardial ischemia  Secondary endpoints
        included stroke  worsening heart failure  need for coronary
        revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the
        study  On average  patients were 65 years of age 
        approximately 65% were men  86% Caucasian and the mean
        baseline low density lipoprotein  LDL  cholesterol level
        was 124 mg dL  Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a
        2 6% absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint
         14 8% vs  17 4%  RR relative risk  RR  0 84  95%
        confidence interval  CI  0 70 1 00  p   0 048   This
        reduction was primarily driven by the 2 2% absolute
        reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for
        symptomatic myocardial ischemia  6 2% vs  8 4%  RR 0 74 
        95% CI 0 57 0 95  p   0 02   The risk of death  nonfatal
        myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death
        were each no different between the two groups  While there
        were no significant differences in the incidence of
        worsening heart failure or need for coronary
        revascularization  atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of
        fatal or non fatal stroke by 0 8%  0 8% vs  1 6%  RR 0 50 
        95% CI 0 26 0 99  p   0 045   Atorvastatin also
        significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol and
        triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high
        density lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol by 16 weeks  By 16
        weeks  the adjusted mean LDL cholesterol decreased to 72
        mg dL in atorvastatin treated patients but increased to 135
        mg dL among placebo treated patients  No serious adverse
        events occurred as the result of treatment with
        atorvastatin  although reversible liver transaminase
        elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal
        occurred in 2 5% of atorvastatin treated versus 0 6% of
        placebo treated patients  p < 0 001  
      
      
        The MIRACuLous
        The efficacy and safety findings from MIRACL were unique
        for a number of reasons  Although lipid lowering therapy
        was associated with a significantly lower mortality when
        initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two
        large observational studies   6 7     MIRACL was the first
        randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical
        benefits in this setting  It was also the first trial to
        identify a short term  ie  within 16 weeks  clinical
        benefit from statin therapy  in previous secondary
        prevention trials  the benefit of statin therapy was not
        evident for one to two years  And  while clinical trial
        safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous  MIRACL s
        most important contribution may have been that high dose
        statin therapy was not associated with serious harm 
        despite its use in the unstable setting  Earlier secondary
        prevention statin trials had excluded patients with
        unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical
        concern that statin mediated reductions in vascular smooth
        muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque 
        That no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment
        strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so
        remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of
        lipid lowing therapy after coronary events 
      
      
        The not so MIRACuLous
        Despite these unique and important findings  there were
        a number of inherent study limitations worth noting  First
        and foremost  the possibility of a null treatment effect
        cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals  and
        hence marginally significant p value of 0 048  for the
        effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint 
        Furthermore  while the number of patients lost to follow up
        was small  if adverse events had occurred in those treated
        with atorvastatin  n   3  but not placebo  n   8   the
        overall trial results may have been neutral rather than
        positive 
        The types of events prevented in MIRACL are also worth
        noting  While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial
        ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and
        health care costs  other important endpoints were not
        significantly affected  eg  death  myocardial infarction 
        resuscitated sudden cardiac death  worsening heart failure 
        need for coronary revascularization  etc   The question of
        whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events
        when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will
        require further study 
        The short duration of follow up is also particularly
        troubling  While it is impressive that a clinical benefit
        was realized after only 16 weeks of statin therapy  the
        increased risk of adverse clinical events persists
        throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome 
        Without longer clinical follow up  it is not possible to
        assess the intermediate term effect  if any  of
        atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial
        infarction  To do so would be critical in light of the lack
        of effect on these important endpoints at 16 weeks 
        Unfortunately  no late clinical follow up is planned 
        There were also a number of limitations that may have
        hampered the study s generalizability  First  patients who
        underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was
        planned were excluded  Specifically  patients who underwent
        percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty  PTCA  or
        coronary artery bypass graft  CABG  surgery within the
        previous three or six months respectively were not eligible
        for inclusion  The investigators reasoned that recurrent
        ischemic events in this population were likely to result
        from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins
        would be less likely to affect these processes   8    
        Nevertheless  a number of trials have established the
        benefits of statin therapy 
        early after coronary
        revascularization   9 10 11     Furthermore  a number of
        recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with
        non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when
        an early invasive strategy is applied   12 13 14   and it
        is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion 
        Second  patients with Q wave myocardial infarction were not
        eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins
        would not influence the development of important prognostic
        determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
        ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications   5    
        Nevertheless  patients who develop electrocardiographic
        Q waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients
        with myocardial infarction  While their short term risk
        following hospital discharge is lower relative to those
        with a non Q wave myocardial infarction  it is still much
        greater than in patients with stable coronary disease  and
        the need for secondary prevention in this population is
        equally important  Third  despite the high risk nature of
        enrolled patients  ie  electrocardiogram  ECG  changes
        and or other objective evidence of ischemia   the rate of
        platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitor utilization was
        quite low  1 1%   Such therapy appears to be cost effective
          15 16     especially among high risk patients and is
        recommended under current American College of
        Cardiology American Heart Association guidelines   17    
        Fourth  it may not be possible to ascertain whether these
        findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary
        syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels  The small
        difference in number of primary endpoint events between
        atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to
        dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and
        treatment effect further  Consequently  it remains
        uncertain whether one can extrapolate the MIRACL trial
        results to those who undergo coronary revascularization
        shortly before or after a coronary event  who present with
        a Q wave myocardial infarction  who are treated with
        platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitors  or who have
        relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels 
      
      
        Time to change current practice
        Although MIRACL and the two aforementioned cohort
        studies suggest that lipid lowering agents exert short term
        clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute
        coronary syndrome  this remains an open question  Even if
        these findings are not confirmed after further study  one
        could still make a compelling argument that lipid lowering
        therapy  barring contraindications  should be initiated
        early and universally in patients who present with an acute
        coronary syndrome  First  the long term safety and
        effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of 
        stable coronary disease is
        well established   1 2 3     Second  as evidenced by
        MIRACL  these agents are safe when initiated at the time of
        hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome  Third  the
        in hospital initiation of lipid lowering therapy appears to
        promote greater long term utilization of these agents   18
        19 20 21     Finally  although lipid levels may be
        unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome
         excepting total  HDL and LDL HDL cholesterol ratios   22  
          the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary
        disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and
        non pharmacologic lipid lowering interventions to attain
        recommended cholesterol targets   23 24 25     newer
        guidelines are even more stringent   26     Furthermore 
        data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study
        suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of
        baseline cholesterol level   4     Thus  to withhold
        lipid lowering therapy from patients who present with an
        acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo 
        and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the
        secondary prevention setting have been dismal   27 28  
         
      
      
        More MIRACLes ahead?
        The ascertainment and quantification of any incremental
        benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after
        an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation  There
        is currently only one ongoing randomized placebo controlled
        trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this
        setting  A 2 Z  Aggrastat to Zocor  Merck    29     The
        A 2 Z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment
        with simvastatin in 4 500 patients following an episode of
        unstable angina or a non Q wave myocardial infarction  In
        the first four months  patients will be randomized to
        simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo  Thereafter  those
        patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will
        receive 80 mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with
        placebo  40 mg of simvastatin daily  The primary composite
        endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death 
        non fatal myocardial infarction  or rehospitalization for
        an acute coronary syndrome  ACS  at one year  If A 2 Z
        demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of
        adverse events during the first four months  it would
        suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating
        these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome  If
        benefits accrue  but do so later during follow up  it would
        be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more
        aggressive vs  earlier lipid lowering therapy 
        The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection
        Therapy  PROVE IT  trial is looking at 4 000 patients
        within 10 days of an acute coronary syndrome and
        randomizing them to either pravastatin 40 mg or
        atorvastatin 80 mg daily   29     Patients will be observed
        over at least 1 5 years for the occurrence of myocardial
        infarction or other cardiovascular events  Unlike  MIRACL
        and the A 2 Z trials  this study will not assess the
        efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary
        syndrome  rather  it will examine the role of 
        more vs  
        less aggressive lipid lowering in
        this setting 
        In 2002  many would consider it unethical to withhold
        statins from patients with established coronary disease 
        This makes it unlikely that additional placebo controlled
        trials will be carried out in this area  Future secondary
        prevention studies should look at patients with stable 
        or unstable disease and will need to
        address the comparative efficacy of different statins  or
        newer agents   assess the incremental benefit of
        combination therapy   30   and determine whether there is a
        serum cholesterol  floor  below which reductions are
        unlikely to provide further clinical benefit

        Introduction
        Older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight 
        even though there is little evidence that overweight is
        associated with increased mortality in those over age 65 
        Six large controlled population based studies of
        non smoking older adults have investigated the association
        between body mass index  BMI  and mortality  controlling
        for relevant covariates   1 2 3 4 5 6     All studies found
        excess risk for persons with very low BMI  but that persons
        with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except
        in certain small subsets  A review of 13 studies of older
        adults drew similar conclusions   7    
        Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain
        throughout adult life  It may be that a small amount of
        gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the
        most robust health as we age  It has been suggested that
        weight standards be adjusted upwards for age   8     Such
        recommendations remain controversial  however  because the
        number of studies of older persons is fairly small  and
        because few studies have examined the relation of BMI to
        quality of life or years of healthy life  YHL  in the
        elderly   9    
        In older adults  risk factors may have a greater effect
        on health than on mortality  If so  then behavior change
        trials of weight modification might be more successful if
        they were evaluated on improved health  rather than on
        decreased mortality  Clinical trials powered to detect
        differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects than
        trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular
        events   10     In this paper we study whether BMI at
        baseline is associated with living longer  and or with more
        years of being healthy  in a cohort of older adults for
        whom risk factors  subclinical disease  and morbidity are
        well characterized  The goal is to determine whether
        analyses based on years of life  YOL  or on YHL would
        provide substantively different results  and which measure
        would yield more powerful evaluations of weight
        modification interventions in older adults 
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Study design  The Cardiovascular Health
          Study
          The Cardiovascular Health Study  CHS  is a
          population based longitudinal study of 5 888 adults aged
          65 and older at baseline   11     Subjects were recruited
          from a random sample of the Medicare eligibility lists in
          four US counties  Extensive baseline data were collected
          for all subjects using a baseline home interview  an
          annual mail questionnaire  and annual clinic
          examinations  Additional information was collected in a
          brief telephone interview 6 months after each scheduled
          visit  Two cohorts were followed  one with 7 years of
          follow up  n   5 201  and the second  all African
          American  n   687  with 4 years of follow up to date 
          Data collection began in 1989  and follow up is virtually
          complete for all surviving subjects   12    
        
        
          Body mass index
          BMI was calculated as measured weight in kilograms
          divided by the square of measured height in meters  A
          report from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute
          classifies normal weight  without reference to age  as a
          BMI of 18 5 to 24 9  overweight as 25 to 29 9  and
          obesity as 30 0 and higher   13     We consider
          separately the group with BMI between 18 5 and 20  which
          was associated with lower survival in studies cited
          above 
        
        
          Years of life and years of healthy life
          YOL is the number of years that a person lived in the
          7 years after baseline  YHL is the number of years in
          which the person was  healthy   and is similar in concept
          to quality adjusted life years  healthy year equivalents 
          or active life expectancy   14     We based YHL on
          self rated health  is your health excellent  very good 
          good  fair  or poor?   EVGFP  which was collected every 6
          months  EVGFP is a simple but well known measure  which
          has been studied in detail   15 16     and is predictive
          of health events in many studies   17     Because we are
          examining health status over time  we added a sixth
          health state  dead  Data were available about 93% of the
          time  We used linear interpolation to estimate missing
          data when there were known values before and after the
          missing value  bringing the percent complete to 95%   18
             
          For this analysis we defined YHL as the number of
          years  of 7  in which a person reported excellent  very
          good  or good health  were  healthy    YHL ranges from 0
           for persons who were never in excellent  very good  or
          good health  to 7 years  for persons who were healthy
          throughout   Since people reported their health every 6
          months  YHL has a reasonably continuous distribution  A
          drawback of this simple definition of  healthy  is that
          it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and
          death  since all are considered  not healthy   We also
          used an alternative approach  which assigns a different
          value to each level of EVGFP   19     Preliminary results
          were similar for the two approaches  however  and we
          report results using only the simpler definition 
          The calculations had to be modified to include the 438
          persons in the second African American cohort  who have
          been followed only 4 years to date  For those persons 
          and for 70 persons in the first cohort who did not have
          complete data  we estimated the last 4 years of YOL and
          YHL from their age  sex  and health at the end of 3
          years  using validated methods presented elsewhere   20  
            That article showed that estimated 4 year YOL and YHL
          were unbiased for the African American cohort  In the
          primary analysis we used observed 7 year YOL and YHL when
          they were available  and observed 3 year YOL and YHL plus
          4 year estimated YOL and YHL when they were not  about
          10% of the sample   We performed all analyses with and
          without the persons who had partially estimated data  to
          ensure that the estimation had not distorted the
          findings 
        
        
          Covariates
          The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL
          with BMI  To adjust for possible confounding we chose
          baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly 
          related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies 
          and likely to be related to BMI  Self reported covariates
          include age  gender  smoking  never or former   history
          of arthritis  cancer  diabetes  fair or poor self rated
          health status  limitations in activities of daily living
          or in instrumental activities of daily living  and 10
          pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before
          baseline  Clinical covariates include hypertension 
          cardiovascular disease  prevalent heart disease 
          peripheral vascular disease  or cerebrovascular disease  
          maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery 
          depression  CESD score   serum albumin  serum
          cholesterol  and serum creatinine  These measures are
          explained in more detail elsewhere   21 22 23 24     We
          excluded 697 current smokers and 313 others with
          incomplete covariate data  leaving 4 878 persons on whom
          this analysis is based 
        
        
          Analysis
          All analyses were performed separately for men and
          women  We calculated two sets of adjusted values  as
          follows  We regressed YOL and YHL first on age  age
          squared  race  and smoking history  former or never   and
          second on all of the covariates listed above  We
          calculated adjusted YOL as a person s observed YOL minus
          predicted YOL  from the regression  plus the mean YOL
           6 52 years for women or 6 06 for men   That is  a
          person s adjusted YOL is his residual from the regression
          plus the grand mean  The mean of this new variable  for a
          group of subjects  is the adjusted mean YOL for that
          group  Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner 
          We calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of
          the possibility of  over adjustment   controlling
          inappropriately for factors  such as diabetes  which may
          have been causally affected by the person s weight  We
          plotted mean adjusted YOL and YHL against BMI  and tested
          for difference among BMI groups using confidence
          intervals or analysis of variance  Finally we calculated
          the effect size for each measure  comparing each BMI
          subgroup to the  normal  group  The effect size is the
          difference in mean YOL  or YHL  in two groups divided by
          their common standard deviation  Since the sample size
          required to detect an effect of this magnitude is
          proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size 
          large effect sizes are desirable 
        
      
      
        Results
        Table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex
        and race  Mean age at baseline was 73 1 and about two
        thirds of the men and a third of the women were former
        smokers  Black women had a higher mean BMI and higher
        percent obese  BMI ≥ 30  than the other three groups  Black
        men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than
        10 pounds in the past year  white women were least
        likely 
        About 78% of the subjects were healthy at baseline

        not shown   Of the 22% who were unhealthy  fair or poor  at
        baseline  about 24% were healthy 7 years later  There was
        thus substantial change in EVGFP over time  in both
        directions  Table 1shows the mean YOL and YHL  calculated
        from EVGFP  in the first seven years of the study  adjusted
        to age 73  For example  black women averaged 6 3 YOL  but
        only 4 2 YHL of a maximum possible 7  We calculated some
        additional descriptive statistics  shown in the final two
        lines  years of unhealthy life  YOL minus YHL  and years
        lost to death  7 minus YOL   White women had the most YHL
        and black men the fewest  black women had the most years of
        unhealthy life  and white men the fewest  black men lost
        the most years to death  1 3 out of 7  while white women
        lost only 0 4 years  For blacks  about 68% of their YOL
        were healthy  YHL YOL  not shown   for whites  about 75%
        were healthy 
        Among whites  the gender differences in Table 1were
        statistically significant  p < 05  except for BMI and
        unintended weight loss  Among blacks  gender differences
        were significant except for 10 pounds unintended weight
        loss and weight loss since age 50  Among males  there were
        significant differences between black and white for BMI 
        unintended weight loss  YOL  YHL  years of unhealthy life 
        and years lost to death  Whites in the sample had higher
        income and education  data not shown   After adjusting for
        income and education  as well as age and former smoking 
        the difference in BMI was no longer statistically
        significant  Among females  blacks and whites differed
        significantly on BMI  BMI>30  weight loss since age 50

        After adjustment for income and education  the difference

        Blacks had significantly lower YOL and YHL than whites
        after adjustment for age  but the difference disappeared
        after adjustment for the entire set of health related
        baseline covariates  analyses not shown  
        We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL 
        Table 2presents the mean values of YOL and YHL  adjusted
        for age  race  and previous smoking  columns 1 and 3   and
        also adjusted for the entire set of covariates  columns 2
        and 4   For example  YOL for women  adjusted for age  race 
        and smoking  averaged 6 0 years for women with a baseline
        BMI below 18 5  but averaged 6 6 years for women with a BMI
        from 25 to 29 9  The second column  which shows results
        adjusted for all covariates  is not very different  the
        only discrepancy is for men with BMI < 18 5  a category
        containing only 14 men   Adjustment for extensive
        covariates also made little difference for YHL  columns 3
        and 4   Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age 
        race  and former smoking  As mentioned above  the group
        with BMI from 18 5 to 20 would be considered  normal  by
        the NHLBI guidelines  but had lower YOL and YHL than those
        with 20 24 9 in all comparisons  For this reason  and to
        increase sample size for those with low BMI  we combined
        the two lower categories  defining underweight as a BMI
        under 20 
        Figure 1is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and
        BMI  For each BMI category the mean and its 95% confidence
        interval are plotted  Categories whose confidence intervals
        do not overlap  or overlap only slightly  are significantly
        different  The bars are slightly offset to permit all error
        bars to be seen 
        YOL for women  the uppermost curve on Figure 1  averaged
        about 6 5 out of 7 years  and showed no evident association
        between BMI and YOL for BMI above 20  Underweight women
        averaged about  25 fewer YOL than other women  p <  05
        compared with normal group   Underweight men also had lower
        YOL  but this group was not significantly different from
        the normal group  in part because of low sample size  Men
        classified as normal  overweight or obese all had about the
        same YOL 
        The lowermost two lines in Figure 1show mean YHL for
        women and men  Women who were normal or overweight averaged
        about 4 9 YHL  The YHL for underweight or obese women was
        about 4 5 years  which was significantly lower than the
        normal group  The relationship of BMI to YHL for men is
        similar  but differences among BMI groups were not
        statistically significant  YHL was significantly higher for
        women than for men in the normal and overweight groups  but
        the sexes had similar YHL in the underweight and obese
        groups 
        We next present the effect size for comparing each group
        to the normal BMI group  The effect sizes are shown in
        Table 3  with the significance results of the associated
        t tests for the differences in means of the two groups
        being compared  For example  underweight women averaged
        4 50 YHL compared to 4 92 for normal women  and the common
        standard deviation was 1 44  The effect size is thus
         4 92 4 50  1 44    29  The two groups had significantly
        different YHL  implying that the effect size is also
        significantly greater than zero  A clinical trial of a
        treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight
         presumably by addressing the underlying cause  could be
        expected to have 80% power with N    1 96  84  2  29 2 
        about 93 women per treatment arm  if 7 year YHL were the
        outcome measure 
        The biggest effect sizes are in the first row  comparing
        underweight to normal  YHL and YOL have similar effect
        sizes for women  and are significantly different from zero 
        The effect sizes are not significantly different from zero
        for men  in part because there were only 42 men in the
        underweight category  The effect size comparing overweight
        to normal yielded small  non significant effect sizes  with
        inconsistent signs  suggesting extremely large sample sizes
        would be needed  For comparing obese to normal  only YHL
        for women showed a large and significant effect size  Thus 
        an intervention to improve the health of underweight women
        to that of their normal weight peers could be performed
        using either YHL or YOL as the outcome variable  Trials to
        make obese women comparable to normal women could be
        evaluated using YHL  but not YOL  Trials to improve the
        health of the other groups to that of the normals would
        probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being
        overweight  for men or women  or obese  for men  affects
        YOL or YHL 
        As mentioned above  we repeated these analyses excluding
        the persons with partially estimated data  and using two
        different ways of coding YHL  The only substantive change
        was that some of the differences between blacks and whites
        shown in Table 1were no longer statistically significant 
        due to a smaller sample size 
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Optimal weight and overweight
          Recent studies have defined obesity without reference
          to age   6 13 30     Andres 
          et al proposed a desirable BMI of
          24 30 for persons aged 60 to 69   8     Allison 
          et al   31   proposed 27 30 for
          older men and 30 35 for older women  In Figure 1  the
          overweight  as opposed to the obese  are no different
          from those of normal weight  suggesting that these two
          categories could be combined for older adults  Since
          future improvements in life expectancy may be limited  
          32     the greatest advances may be made by improving
          people s YHL  This suggests that the development of
          future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of
          quality of life into account 
        
        
          Implications for clinical trials
          Based on these findings  trials to address obesity in
          older women could be efficient if YHL  but not YOL  was
          the outcome measure  That is  women who changed from
          being obese to being normal would likely show changes in
          YHL  but not YOL  Clinical trials of weight modification
          interventions for older adults who were merely overweight
          would appear to be fruitless since the interventions
          would probably not have a direct effect on either YOL or
          YHL 
          Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the
          outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or
          exercise programs  The fact that weight is not associated
          in a consistent way with health suggests that such
          evaluations should be considered critically when older
          adults are the subjects  This is particularly important
          in the light of recent findings  which found that
          interventions such as weight loss drugs may be harmful  
          33 34     For older adults  the risks associated with
          higher weight are especially unclear  and the optimal
          outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults
          requires specific attention to improved health and
          mortality 
          Interestingly  the strongest health relationships were
          found for underweight older adults  Clinical trials whose
          objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their
          normal weight peers  presumably by addressing the
          underlying conditions that caused the low weight  could
          be performed efficiently using either YOL or YHL as the
          outcome measure  Both YOL and YHL would be clinically
          significant in this patient group 
        
        
          Potential limitations
          CHS participants were somewhat healthier than the
          average older adult  however  adjustment for detailed
          covariates made little difference in the findings  We
          estimated the last four years of health data for about
          10% of the sample  but results with and without this
          group were similar  Analysis of mean YOL instead of the
          more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was
          appropriate here  since virtually no persons were lost to
          follow up  Biases caused by over adjustment are probably
          not large  since the findings were not sensitive to the
          number of variables adjusted for 
          These results are for a 7 year follow up  The relative
          superiority of YHL to YOL would probably hold in trials
          with shorter follow up  The effect sizes in Table 3might
          also be appropriate in shorter trials  since lengthy
          trials often add little information   10    
          EVGFP  on which YHL was based  might have missed some
          effects of obesity on risk factors for future health  A
          person who is depressed because of a poor self image
          related to obesity or who has osteo arthritis related to
          obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid
          pain would surely have worse EVGFP than others  based on
          results from many studies  However  health measures
          designed specifically to measure those conditions might
          be more sensitive to change in weight than EVGFP  If YHL
          were based on such measures  the superiority of YHL to
          YOL would likely be even greater than that shown here 
          These more sensitive measures might also have detected
          differences between the overweight and normal weight
          persons  but we think this is unlikely given the absence
          of any differences in EVGFP 
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Recommendations for desirable weight have been
        criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health  We
        found associations between YHL and obesity that were not
        present in the mortality analysis  suggesting that YHL may
        be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in
        older adults  especially for women  Future efforts to
        determine desirable weight guidelines should include
        measures of YHL  Using either YOL or YHL  however  we found
        no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as
         overweight  by the NHLBI guidelines  This suggests using
        YHL as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving
        obese or underweight older adults  and discouraging trials
        that address older adults who are merely overweight

        Dublin and the Dubliners
        As capital of Europe’s most explosive economy  Dublin seems
        to be changing before your very eyes  New construction is everywhere 
        the streets buzz  traffic is increasingly congested  and in the
        frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing
        places with everyone else  At night the streets are crowded with people
        bent on having a good time  Prosperity is in the air  the roar of the
        “Celtic Tiger” can clearly be heard 
        But this is not the whole picture  The proverbial
        hospitality and warm welcome are still here  This busy  modern European
        city sits on a thousand years of history — history is present
        everywhere  from elegant Merrion Square to the bullet holes on the
        General Post Office  It’s also a city of the imagination  reinvented
        and reappraised in the literature of its exiles  And the old Dublin is
        with us  too — the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar
        magic possessed by Ireland and the Irish 
        Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic
        preservation  Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor  You
        can view artifacts from the Bronze Age  trace the history of the Easter
        Rising  or revisit Leopold Bloom’s odyssey in Ulysses  Old buildings
        are being recycled  for example  the 17th century Royal Hospital now
        holds the Museum of Modern Art  And Dublin  a city large in
        expectations  is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its
        sights on foot 
        City on the Liffey
        The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center
        of the city to Dublin Bay  The river forms a natural line between the
        north and south sections of the city  This geography is important in
        understanding Dublin  Historically and culturally this north south
        distinction has always been significant  and it still is today  with a
        dose of good humored rivalry between the two areas  “ I never go north
        of the Liffey ” one man remarked 
        Farther out  both north and south  are the sweeping curves
        of the Royal and Grand Canals  The occasional cry of gulls and
        unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea 
        and the Wicklow mountains  which hold Dublin closely to the coast  are
        visible from everywhere 
        Dublin is an intimate city  physically small but tightly
        packed  a perfect place for walking  College Green  the home of Trinity
        College  provides a natural focus just south of the O’Connell Street
        bridge  O’Connell Street  the city’s grand boulevard  leads north to
        Parnell Square  To the south and east is St  Stephen’s Green and
        Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located  Along the
        Liffey to the west is Temple Bar  center of nightlife and home to many
        of Dublin’s cutting edge artists and artistic endeavors  Up the hill
        from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral 
        It won’t rain on you in Dublin all the time  The climate
        here can best be described as “changeable” and yet the sudden shifts
        from light to dark  sunshine to shower  are part of the city’s magic 
        Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light  Dublin
        under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine 
        Enjoying Dublin
        Literature has always flourished in Dublin  the only city
        to have produced three Nobel Prize winners for literature — Yeats 
        Shaw  and Beckett  Joyce  the high priest of literary Modernism 
        imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses  you’ll see
        references to it all over   However  sometimes it seems that the city
        produced artists of this stature by accident  even against its will 
        Beckett and Joyce  among others  had to leave their homeland to
        understand it —  and to be understood 
        Dublin theater is legendary  and no visitor should miss
        seeing a performance at the Abbey Theatre or Gate Theatre  The city’s
        impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob
        Geldof is well known — there’s even a self guided tour of their haunts 
        Traditional Irish music is also alive and well  especially in the pubs 
        and there has been a revival of storytelling  poetry reading  and
        traditional dancing  And in this city  where literature and theater
        have historically dominated the scene  visual arts are finally coming
        into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries
        that display the work of modern Irish artists 
        The constantly crowded and busy Grafton street is the most
        visible center for shopping  but there are shops all over that carry an
        international array of goods as well as the Irish crafts and souvenirs
        you expect  And while multinational chains have made inroads  they seem
        less blatant here than elsewhere  Many shops  and also hotels and guest
        houses  have been owned and managed by the same families for years  and
        theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality 
        Dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis  There was a
        time when you might have apologized for it  but no longer  Dublin has
        international restaurants galore  and the New Irish Cuisine is built
        upon fresh products of Ireland’s seas  rivers  and farms  Coffee has
        replaced the ubiquitous tea — Dublin is now almost as much a coffee
        city as Vienna or Seattle 
        City and Countryside
        In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising
        that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation  Phoenix
        Park in the northwest is the largest open space  but squares like St 
        Stephen’s Green are the garden oases of the city 
        On the coast  Sandymount  Dollymount  and Killiney strands
        are the places to go  The beautiful Wicklow Mountains  and the Wicklow
        Mountains National Park provide a more rugged countryside  and the area
        has breathtaking houses and gardens such as Castletown  Mount Usher 
        and Powerscourt  To the north and west are the ancient sites of
        Ireland  Malahide Castle  the evocative hill of Tara  and the long
        barrows of Knowth and Newgrange 
        The DART  Dublin Area Rapid Transit  runs north and south
        along the coast  It’s an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying
        sights and villages  There are many guided bus tours to sights outside
        the city  and some are accessible by city bus 
        Young at Heart?
        Dublin is a young city  Almost half of Ireland’s population
        is under twenty five  and with its universities and professional
        schools  Dublin also has a large student population  The universities
        attract students from all over the world  and this influx helps to make
        Dublin a busy  buzzing international city  However  young and old 
        stranger and Dubliner rub shoulders quite happily  Religion and respect
        for parents has not yet gone out of fashion  And young graduates are
        not leaving now — multinational corporations and European Union
        investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home 
        Unemployment is at an all time low  The Irish are actually beginning to
        come home 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        A Brief History
        Early Habitation
        The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to
        23 000 b c    when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake 
        During this period  the indigenous people lived in caves  hunting the
        mammals that gathered at the shoreline  The landscape of the valley
        changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries  The glaciers feeding
        the lake melted away and the lake evaporated  Fossils tell an obscure
        story of man’s slow and sporadic development 
        Around 3000 b c    native Archaic Indians began to develop a
        lasting hunting and gathering culture  By this time  the valley was in
        much the same geographic state as it exists in today  with one
        exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the
        surface in several areas  These springs fed a network of streams
        draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River  The areas
        surrounding the springs were desert oases  sprawling collections of
        grasses  trees  and wildlife  Many springs lay in areas that would
        eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis 
        For about 4000 years  the Archaics thrived in a culture that
        included many signs of early civilization  Signs of even more
        advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a d    when
        the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley  Far more progressive than the
        Archaics  the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as
        irrigation to assist their harvest  This permitted the Anasazi to
        achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in
        permanent shelters year round without need to follow wildlife 
        Mysteriously  the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a d  1150 
        leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes  another
        hunter gatherer tribe 
        Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the
        Anasazi  the Paiutes were destined to a semi nomadic lifestyle until
        European settlers arrived  changing the nature of existence in the
        valley forever 
        From Mailmen to Mormons
        In the early nineteenth century  America’s western
        territories were still largely unexplored  It was not until 1829 that
        Rafael Rivera  a Mexican scout  found a spring fed valley and dubbed it
        Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering
        exactly where “the meadows” really lay 
        For fifteen years  Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail
        way station  In 1844  American explorer John C  Fremont parked his
        horses at Big Springs  and his report to the government resulted in a
        mail route leading past the spot on its way to California  This put Las
        Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its
        history 
        In 1855  Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising
        reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley 
        they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown  Surrounded
        by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert  the adobe fort became a
        focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years 
        The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the
        desert  trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their
        circumstances and spread the Mormon faith  Additional pressures from
        arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery  Their
        supplies scarce  their harvest meager  and their spirit broken  they
        abandoned the fort in 1858 
        Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver  by
        1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors
        headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold  One
        opportunist who stayed was Octavius Decatur Gass  Bestowed with plenty
        of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this
        day  Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left
        off — at least when it came to ranching and farming  Gass took over the
        abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres  260 hectares  surrounding it 
        dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch  He expanded the ranch and irrigated the
        land so that it would support crops and cattle  His determination had
        other results as well  Gass was named a justice of the peace and a
        territorial legislator 
        Despite his ambition  Gass’ success was short lived  In the
        late 1870s  he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart  so
        Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own  True to wild West
        stereotypes  Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer  leaving his
        strong willed wife  Helen  to assume the duties of the ranch  Through
        1905  Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres  810 hectares  
        making quite a bit of money in the process 
        What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las
        Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across
        almost all of Western America to this day  The railroad was coming  and
        when it arrived  Las Vegas would never be the same again 
        Of Tracks and Tracts
        At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake
        City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West 
        Though the two cities remained unlinked by rail  this was about to
        change quickly  When it did  the Las Vegas Valley  which at the time
        had a non native population of less than 30  would change as well 
        In 1903  officials of the San Pedro  Los Angeles  and Salt
        Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas  eager to secure a right of way for
        their Los Angeles–Salt Lake connection  Las Vegas would serve as a
        major stopover for crew rest and train repair  For all this  the
        railroad needed land  As mapped  the track traveled directly through
        Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch  Stewart sold 99 5 percent of her ranch
        to the railroad  The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes 
        In early 1905  the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake
        City was completed  and train tracks bore right down the center of the
        Las Vegas Valley  On 15 May 1905  the railroad held a land sale — a
        momentous step in Las Vegas history  Standing at the depot at Main and
        Fremont streets  railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had
        subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub  Land speculators
        and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad
        boomtown  and within an afternoon  more than 80 percent of the lots
        were sold 
        Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement  With
        rail service in place and forty blocks of private property  it was
        ready to become a real town  Businesses sprang up overnight  and wooden
        houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early
        settlers had lived  One year after the auction  the population of Las
        Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents  a portent of things to come for
        the next ninety years 
        Dam Good Luck
        From the beginning  Las Vegas was built to serve travelers 
        The railroad needed a way station  and Las Vegas was the place  Growth
        continued for ten years  and by 1915 the town had telephones 
        round the clock electricity  and a growing population — many of whom
        worked in the railroad repair shop  But such heady progress would soon
        come to a halt 
        The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union
        Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line  Union Pacific then
        consolidated its operations  eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility 
        Additionally  Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark
        County in 1909  a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling 
        These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the
        status of a small desert community that could no longer support its
        3000 residents  But the southwest’s growing need for water  combined
        with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River  would give
        Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity 
        Construction on Hoover Dam  originally Boulder Dam 
        subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project 
        began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles  72 km  southeast of Las Vegas 
        Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy  Hoover
        Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up  both
        financially and literally  Not only did it create jobs  but it also
        created Lake Mead  the massive reservoir that today provides water to
        all of southern Nevada 
        More Government Help
        The construction of Hoover Dam did not single handedly save
        Las Vegas  however  The state legislature helped as well  by legalizing
        gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town  though
        legislators and residents could never have known this at the time 
        The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam’s 1935
        dedication set the city’s now formidable public relations machine into
        action  They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest
        citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted  It didn’t take long for the
        city to establish itself as a wild West town with an “anything goes”
        attitude  Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal
        here  available any hour of any day  or night   Thus originated Las
        Vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park 
        Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from
        World War II  Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School  which became
        Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site  in the north  and Basic
        Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson  arrived in the early 1940s
        as a result of America’s war effort  By 1945  the population had grown
        to almost 20 000  with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace 
        But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore 
        Mobsters and Rat Packers
        While many gambling halls opened Downtown in the 1930s and
        early 1940s  only two were built on the stretch of old Los Angeles
        Highway that ultimately became the Strip  The El Rancho Vegas  1941 
        was the first  followed by the Last Frontier  1943   During this
        period  East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel earned a
        foothold as a local casino operator 
        By 1945 Siegel had become one of Las Vegas’s original
        visionaries  planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the LA
        Highway  When the Flamingo opened in December 1946  it did so with
        Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash  But the Mafia bosses who
        financed the operation were displeased with its performance  Siegel was
        murdered in the summer of 1947 
        Despite its initial failings  Siegel’s Flamingo survived
        him  as did mob infiltration of casinos  In fact  the Flamingo would
        launch over two decades of strong mob presence in Las Vegas  Freely
        flowing “comps”  complimentary food  drink  and entertainment  were the
        order of the day  with mob bosses content to provide an environment of
        pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in 
        While the mob was running the casinos  promoters were
        busily selling Las Vegas as a glamorous Hollywood in the desert  From
        the mid 1940s to the mid 1960s  Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that
        it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World  ” Emerging stars  no
        longer content with playing small nightclubs  came to Las Vegas with
        dreams of making it big  Many of them did  Frank Sinatra  Wayne Newton 
        and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found
        themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were
        written  The Rat Pack — originally Frank Sinatra  Dean Martin  Sammy
        Davis Jr    Peter Lawford  and Joey Bishop  all in town to film Ocean’s
        11 — landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay  Other
        Hollywood stars came as well  simply because Las Vegas was the place to
        be 
        As a result  more casinos emerged along the Strip  The
        Thunderbird  Desert Inn  Sahara  Sands  and Riviera hotels were erected
        during this period  luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of
        all night partying  exclusive entertainment  and cheap accommodations 
        There was no longer any question  when you wanted some unbridled adult
        fun  Las Vegas was the place to be 
        New Legitimacy
        Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in
        its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash  Though Las Vegas had
        developed a powerful local economy  few major outside investments were
        made in the city  due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent
        ties to illegal activities 
        That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of
        billionaire Howard Hughes  A legitimate businessman  Hughes was
        nonetheless eccentric and dramatic  a style suited to the Las Vegas
        ethos  True to the myth  the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered
        himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse  Several weeks later he was
        asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high
        rollers  whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the
        management  Thus began Hughes’ legendary three year  $300 million Las
        Vegas buying spree  When it was over  Hughes owned six casinos  an
        airport  and an airline  along with numerous plots of land stretching
        from the Strip to the mountains 
        Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions  both
        immediate and lasting  Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired
        from Hughes’ investments  established companies such as Hilton Hotels
        bought into the gaming business  and their influence helped draw a line
        in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos  where
        illegal skimming of profits was rampant  That  combined with the
        formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board  would signal the
        beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city 
        Las Vegas with a Vision
        As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out 
        a new Las Vegas emerged  The legitimization of gambling led to its
        increased legalization across the US  What was once a sure thing became
        much more competitive  Casino operators had to reassess the nature of
        their business 
        The first to really do so was Steve Wynn  a Las Vegas
        resident and owner of the Golden Nugget  In the mid 1980s  Wynn began
        plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort  He bought several
        Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and
        demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which
        became an instant success 
        Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a
        trend that  more than any other  describes Las Vegas at the end of the
        20th century  removal of old properties in exchange for the potential
        of new ones  This trend has led to many more demolitions  including the
        Dunes  replaced by Bellagio   Aladdin  the new Aladdin  and Sands
         Venetian  hotels 
        Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards  They can no
        longer be just a box filled with gaming tables  restaurants  and a
        showroom  Excalibur  the MGM Grand  the Luxor  and New York New York
        all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s  offering themed
        environments and attractions for families 
        As evidence of the “ever faster” nature of the city  by the
        middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash  with
        many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience 
        The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post mob era  the
        comprehensive resort  New resorts offer attractions and amenities
        modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide  including
        luxurious spas  signature restaurants  and exclusive boutiques 
        Additionally  a handful of resorts — such as the South Seas
        themed Mandalay Bay  the Mirage  and the new Four Seasons — are now
        catering exclusively to the luxury travel market  The crème de la crème
        of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn’s Bellagio  The world’s most
        expensive resort at $1 6 billion  the Bellagio’s amenities include
        5 star dining  Chanel caliber boutiques  and a world class collection
        of artistic masterworks  Perhaps more important  such high end
        accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the
        mythology of the Rat Pack era 
        As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming
        venue  the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed  Over 20 000 additional
        hotel rooms have been added in a few short years  including resorts in
        Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas  Recent business projections for Las Vegas
        predict challenges  tourism revenues must increase substantially to
        sustain what is already built  while actual figures show visitation as
        steady or declining  The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for
        nearly a century may be facing a roadblock 
        Still  the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as
        much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else 
        With its new look and new aim  the prospects are good despite the
        warnings  Inevitably  some people will get burned in the process  but
        others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes 
        And that  more than anything  is the one constant that characterizes
        the past  present  and future of Las Vegas 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        Hong Kong and
        Its People
        Exciting  mysterious  glamorous — these words have described
        Hong Kong for at least a century  With its vibrant atmosphere and
        night and day activity it is an intoxicating place  Hong Kong is
        crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities  But
        it is also efficient  with one of the best transportation systems
        anywhere  and for such a crowded place  quiet — you don’t hear voices
        raised in anger  motorists sitting on their horns  or loud boomboxes 
        Shopping never ends — there’s always another inviting spot just down
        the street  You’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around  the people
        helpful  English spoken everywhere  and food that lives up to its
        reputation 
        On 1 July  1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong
        reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of
        the People’s Republic of China  Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist
        enclave with its laws and rights intact  and China has promised that
        Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years 
        Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and
        stability makes sense  Hong Kong has long been China’s handiest window
        on the West  and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know how and
        managerial expertise  Around the time of the transition there was much
        speculation about how things would change  But in fact  once news of
        the handover vanished from the front pages  the people of Hong Kong
        returned to their usual topics of conversation  the economy and the
        price of housing 
        The impression of the visitor today will be that very little
        has changed  Establishments are no longer called “Royal ” Queen
        Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage  and the Union Jack has been
        replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its
        bauhinia flower  But in fact  there have been changes  many of them due
        to economic progress  new construction  and other factors that
        influence cities all over the world 
        Others are more subtle  British social customs are still
        evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long
        lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour  The British population
        has decreased  today there are as many American and Australian ex pats
        as there are British 
        With a population of nearly eight million and a total area
        of just over 1 095 square km  423 square miles   housing is one of Hong
        Kong’s perennial nightmares  To alleviate the problem  the government
        has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive
        apartment blocks that  though they have every modern facility  average
        only 9 square m  100 square ft  in size  Whole cities have been created
        in the New Territories  although the unimaginative architecture of
        these towns has been criticized 
        Of Hong Kong’s population  98 percent are Chinese  The
        majority are Cantonese  born in Hong Kong  or from South China  but
        there are immigrants from all over China  The Chinese people have been
        described as hardworking and pragmatic  attitudes that have contributed
        to Hong Kong’s success  There are many stories of refugees who arrived
        with nothing in their pockets  set up a small sidewalk stall  worked
        diligently until they had their own store  and then expanded it into a
        modest chain 
        Old customs are still followed  Fate and luck are taken very
        seriously  and astrologers and fortune tellers do a steady business 
        Before a skyscraper can be built  a feng shui  see page 68 
        investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building
        will promote health  harmony  and prosperity  You’ll also notice that
        gambling is a passion  whether it be cards  mah jong  the lottery  or
        the horses  Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive
        off track betting system  and on weekends the ferries to Macau are
        crowded with people on their way to the casinos 
        Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the
        enthralling water traffic — a mix of freighters  ferries  tugs  junks 
        and yachts  Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic  From
        Victoria Peak  Hong Kong’s highest point  or from skyscrapers and
        hotels  they are especially exciting at night when the lights are
        on 
        The business and financial center and the signature soaring
        architecture are on Hong Kong Island  Across Victoria Harbor  connected
        by ferry and the MTR rail line  is the Kowloon peninsula with its
        hotels  nightlife  and almost non stop shopping  Beyond  in the New
        Territories  are a mixture of high rise suburban towns  ancient sites
        and walled villages  country parks  and farms with ducks and fish
        ponds  Hong Kong’s other  less developed islands  Lantau  Lamma  and
        Cheung Chau  provide getaways  You can also take a ferry to Macau to
        find an entirely different kind of city  a unique blend of Chinese and
        Iberian culture 
        It’s anyone’s guess what may happen in the future  but for
        now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition  and for the visitor 
        this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating
        experience 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        a brief History
        Prehistoric man in Asia Minor  now modern Turkey  or Greece
        could look out across the Aegean toward the horizon and see the faint
        silhouette of land  Their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that
        were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands 
        marking the start of the long legacy of Mediterranean seafaring 
        Around 7000 b c    the Phoenicians set out from what is now
        Iran to explore their surroundings  They eventually reached the
        islands  and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part
        of the Aegean Sea  An important early material  obsidian  was
        discovered on the island of Milos  Obsidian is a hard  vitreous
        volcanic rock  which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and
        stabbing  The high quality of the seam on Milos ensured that the area
        remained popular with early travelers 
        The basic elements of life in the Aegean began to come
        together as early as 5000 b c    and were already in place by the late
        Bronze Age  c  2700 b c     The major changes were not to daily tasks
        and routines  but to the political power base  which changed regularly
        and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages 
        Cycladic Culture
        At around 3500 b c    a sophisticated culture evolved in the
        Cyclades islands  The distinctive  sculpted marble figures of the era
        are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs  You will find
        original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the
        Cyclades  although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on
        Paros  The people farmed and fished  on the dawning of the Bronze Age
        in 2700 b c    they began to work with metals  The Cycladic culture was
        influenced by societies in the east  importing the pottery wheel from
        Mesopotamia  They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local
        marble 
        The Minoans and the Myceneans
        Farther south in Crete  the Minoan culture developed after
        2000 b c  into the most significant of its age  spreading its influence
        throughout the region by trade and diplomacy  Santorini  Thira   the
        next major island north  was heavily influenced by Crete  and the
        settlements of Thira and Akrotiri thrived at this time  The magnificent
        frescoes and mosaics found at Akrotiri are in Athens at present  but
        the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the
        sophistication of the culture here 
        Around 1500 b c    a massive volcanic eruption at Santorini
        destroyed not only Akrotiri — under feet of ash and pumice — but the
        whole Minoan civilization  Massive tidal waves swept over Crete  and
        other parts of the Mediterranean  smashing buildings and drowning many
        thousands of people 
        In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval  the Aegean
        Islands next came under the influence of the Mycenaeans  at around 1300
        b c     who had a base in the Peloponnese region of the Greek mainland 
        The Mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer  not to
        trade  Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by
        Homer in his epic poems The Odyssey and The Iliad 
        The Rise of Athens
        The Dorians  who came overland from northern Europe 
        conquered the Mycenaeans  They were a barbaric race  and their custody
        of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word
        was forgotten and art disappeared  They held sway over islands off the
        northern Greek coast  but the Phoenicians kept control of the main sea
        routes  south of the area  trade continued as usual  At the same time 
        city states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland 
        Athens became the most powerful  heralding the start of the classical
        Greek period  However  Greece was not yet a country  each city state
        was self governing and autonomous 
        The new culture spread throughout the Mediterranean  helped
        by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements
        such as Carthage  a Greek city on the African coast of the
        Mediterranean  Culture and the arts flourished once again  Athletic
        prowess was admired and the Olympic games were constituted in 776 b c 
          to promote friendly competition  Homer wrote his epic works on Chios 
        and lyrical poetry was much admired  particularly the work of the poets
        Archilochos on Paros and Sappho on Lesvos 
        The preeminent islands of this era were Delos  a sacred
        island and center of religion ruled by Athens  Samos  ruled by the
        tyrant Polycrates  and Naxos  whose ruler Lygdamis undertook some major
        building projects  Archaeology shows that  during this time  societies
        lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement
        inland 
        The Persian Wars
        As Athens rose in influence and power in the West  it was
        matched in the East by the rise of the Persian Empire  From a power
        base in Anatolia  the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and
        set their sights on the Cyclades  In 490 b c    they captured sacred
        Delos and razed the settlements on Naxos  The island communities were
        undecided about which side to back for a time  Paros and Andros
        contributed to the Persian armory  while others supported Athens  The
        two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of Marathon and
        Salamis in 480 b c  The Persians were defeated  and Athens duly
        punished the islands that had turned against it 
        Following its victory  Athens introduced the concept of a
        mutual protection alliance  a kind of NATO of the ancient world  
        Several islands and Greek city states agreed to work together  and
        created a treasury to fund their plans  which was held on the island of
        Delos  The alliance became known as the Delian League  Although there
        were minor internal wrangles  the league controlled the Aegean and the
        greater Athenian Empire for most of the fifth century b c  Later  in
        454 b c    the treasury was transferred to Athens and its deposits were
        used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and
        temples of the Classical Age 
        In 431 b c    Athens began a war with its neighbor and
        league member Sparta  Although the islands saw little action  as the
        war went on they could see that Athens was slowly losing its power 
        Before the end of the war in 401 b c    many islands had already
        transferred their allegiance to the victors  who were led by Philip II
        of Macedon  He was followed in 336 b c  by his son Alexander the Great 
        one of the most remarkable leaders in history  His rise to power
        ushered in the Hellenistic period 
        Hellenistic and Roman Periods
        When Alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east
        as India  the Aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes 
        Delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire  Following
        Alexander’s death  his lands were divided among his generals  Much of
        the Aegean came under the rule of the Ptolemies  along with Egypt 
        Cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan 
        Although in 88 b c    Mithradates made a swift and
        successful raid from the East across Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands 
        the next major power change brought influence from the West  The Greek
        Hellenistic Empire was gradually  and peacefully  absorbed into the
        Roman Empire 
        The Byzantine Empire and the Coming of Christianity
        The Romans ruled a pagan empire  but the Aegean had an
        important influence on the early development of Christianity  In a d   
        95  St  John arrived on Patmos  a small rocky island in the Dodecanese 
        as a political prisoner  It was here that he wrote what was to become
        the final book of the New Testament  the Book of Revelation  It wasn’t
        until a d  330  however  when the newly converted Emperor Constantine
        made Byzantium  renamed Constantinople  capital of his Eastern Empire
        that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future Greek
        life 
        The Byzantine Empire had powerful and well fortified
        cities  but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by
        waves of invaders  In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen
        Muslims  a new potent religious force from the East  the Byzantine army
        forcefully enlisted the men of the islands  Disease took a further
        toll  By the time of the Crusades  many of the Aegean islands had been
        practically depopulated 
        As the Byzantine Empire weakened at the end of the first
        millennium  Crusader forces were sent from Western Europe to counter
        the Muslim forces and retake Jerusalem for the Christian faith 
        Unfortunately  their zeal was not matched by their discrimination  The
        crusaders swept through the l and of Byzantium slaughtering Christians
        as well as Muslims  civilians as well as soldiers  Constantinople was
        taken by Crusader forces in 1204  and they stripped the city of manyof
        its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of
        Venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was
        transferred to the monastery at Patmos before the city fell 
        While Byzantine land was being divided  there was no one in
        control of the seas  so pirates raided towns on many of the islands  To
        counter this  the populations moved from their homes on the coast and
        built settlements inland  out of sight of the raiding parties  This
        created a pattern seen today throughout the Aegean of a small port
         skala  which serves an inland settlement or chora  making it easier to
        protect the island from attack 
        The minor Aegean Islands were taken by various powerful
        European noblemen  many of whom were Genoese or Venetian  such as Marco
        Sanudo on Naxos  The noblemen had free rein to create their own
        fiefdoms  The Venetians fortified their main towns — Naxos Town and
        Antiparos Town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of
        narrow alleys and cul de sacs that were designed to confuse and to
        demoralize invaders  The Genoese took control of the eastern Aegean
        Islands  which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and
        trade 
        After a final bloody defeat by the Muslims in 1309 
        Christian forces were forced from the Holy Land  The Knights of St 
        John  a holy military force  made their way to Rhodes and Kos in the
        Dodecanese  They began the process of building their strong citadels 
        and reinforcing the Christian faith on the islands  However  they had
        not seen the last of their Muslim foe  A force was gaining strength in
        the east to threaten their new bases 
        The Coming of the Ottoman Turks
        The Ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east 
        taking land in what is now Turkey  By the end of the 13th century  they
        began their first raids on the Aegean Islands  In 1453  they took
        Constantinople  and immediately made it their capital  renaming it
        Istanbul 
        They then set their sights on the islands of the Knights of
        St  John and  after an unsuccessful siege in 1480  they finally ejected
        the knights from the Dodecanese in 1522  In 1566  they wrested Chios
        from the Genoese  bolstering their hold on the eastern Aegean Islands 
        but the Cyclades remained in Venetian hands for another generation or
        more — Tinos was the last to fall in 1715  The Ottomans brought new
        influences to the islands that they controlled  forming a large empire
        that stretched around the eastern Mediterranean 
        Toward Greek Independence
        However  a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula
        against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state  In 1770 
        Russia came to aid the Greeks  defined by their Orthodox religion
        rather than by historical geographical boundaries   declaring war on
        the Ottoman Empire and occupying several Aegean islands until 1774 
        Graffiti written by Russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of
        Antiparos 
        Although this attempt was unsuccessful  the campaign for a
        Greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in
        strength  The Aegean Islands played their part  Lesvos  Chios  and
        Samos lay in the important shipping lanes  and patriots began
        disrupting Ottoman cargo traffic  In return  the Turks violently put
        down every insurrection  including the massacre on Chios  when 22 000
        people were slaughtered 
        The Ottoman Empire was weakening  however  and in 1821  the
        peoples of the Greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time 
        The Cyclades and the Sporades island chains were also included in this
        new state  A new sense of identity enveloped Greek peoples throughout
        the Aegean  thus commencing a movement to expand Greece and unify the
        disparate Orthodox populations 
        The Twentieth Century
        A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the
        20th century began to sound a death knell for the Ottoman Empire  The
        Turks lost a short war with Italy  and were forced to relinquish the
        Dodecanese islands to the Italians  Greece took this opportunity to
        absorb the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean and to add
        Macedonia to its mainland territories 
        Following this debacle  the Ottomans then allied themselves
        to Germany in the World War I  losing more territory with the defeat of
        the Germans in that war  Greece was handed a strip of land along the
        western coast of Asia Minor  which for over 2 000 years had had a
        substantial Greek population  Greece moved in to administer the land 
        but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part
        of greater Greece 
        In 1923  Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers 
        and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support  He
        promised a modern state for his people  but as the situation became
        volatile  civil strife broke out in Turkish cities  and those
        considered Greek were victims of threats and violence  Many had to
        leave their birthplaces  fleeing to Lesvos  Chios  and Samos  the
        Greek ruled islands just offshore  Thousands of people arrived with
        little more than the clothes they wore  putting great strain on the
        resources of the islands  Finally  Greece was ousted from its new
        territory in Asia Minor  which became part of the new Turkish
        state 
        Greece attempted to stay out of World War II  but Mussolini
        saw Greece as an ideal addition to his Italian empire  His forces made
        a series of attacks from their bases in the Dodecanese islands 
        including sinking a Greek naval vessel in the harbor of Tinos Town  but
        they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population
        against them  Later the Germans came in force and occupied many of the
        islands 
        After the war  in 1949  the Dodecanese islands finally
        became part of the Greek nation  But the country was politically
        fragmented  with arguments between monarchists and republicans  right
        and left  and tension escalated into civil war  The struggle bypassed
        most of the islands  although there was fierce fighting on Samos  Even
        after the fighting stopped more than a decade later  the country was
        not stable 
        At the same time  the massive growth in air and road
        transport saw shipping decline in importance  The Aegean Islands  which
        for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes  became
        the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of
        several islands came close to collapse 
        In 1967  the military took the reins of power in Athens 
        and until 1974  the “Colonels” held sway with a repressive and brutal
        regime  Many Greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty
        and terror  and many made new homes in the United States and Australia 
        The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism  and Greece
        along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern
        Europeans escaping their damp  cool summers 
        In 1982  Greece joined the European Common Market  now the
        European Union   Since this time  membership has been of great monetary
        benefit to the country  The EU has given large subsidies to develop
        Greece’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient
        monuments 
        Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands 
        and road systems have been expanded and im proved  Private investment
        has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible 
        Politically  the 1990s have been relatively quite times for
        the islands  although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas
        Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused
        consternation within conservative Greek society 
        As the Balkans flared to war once again  Greek nationalism
        has stirred  and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the
        land of Macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers  Whether
        this will ever happen remains to be seen  but perhaps the aid offered
        by Greece to Turkey after 1999’s devastating earthquake is a sign that
        the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to
        diminish 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        What to Do
        Shopping
        Inflation has taken its toll in Hong Kong  While it’s no
        longer the bargain shopping destination it once was  there are still
        some good buys to be had  Since Hong Kong is a duty free port and
        charges no sales tax  goods are cheaper here than in the country where
        they were made  On photographic equipment  electronic goods  and
        watches  you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country 
        Specialty goods and souvenirs  often handmade  come from Hong Kong and
        elsewhere in China  Custom made garments by skillful Hong Kong tailors
        are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable
        garments  Note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to Hong
        Kong’s duty free regime and are subject to tax 
        You’ll find that prices are about the same in Hong Kong
        Central and Kowloon  and somewhat cheaper in Causeway Bay  which caters
        to local shopping  Large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to
        be more expensive than smaller “family” shops tucked away in the side
        streets 
        Stores do not open until 10am or later  but shopping goes on
        into the evening  up to 9 30pm  Most shops are open seven days a week 
        Shops in Central are an exception  they generally close at 6pm and are
        not open on Sunday  The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a
        halt is the Chinese New Year in January or February 
        Buyer Beware  Be aware that name brands  including
        electronics  are sometimes fakes  glass may be sold as jade  and that
        antique you bought may have been made last night  Always ask for a
        receipt that records information about the item  and if you buy an
        antique  be sure to get a certificate of authentication  Needless to
        say  avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take
        you to wondrous bargains 
        The large department stores have fixed prices  but elsewhere
        you should ask whether there is a discount  especially if you buy
        several items in one shop  Compare prices before you buy any
        significant item  Always ask to see the manufacturer’s guarantee when
        purchasing watches  cameras  and audio visual and electronic
        equipment 
        Note that when haggling  the merchant assumes you are
        prepared to pay cash  If  after concluding a deal  you try to pay with
        a credit card  he may then boost the price in order to cover the card
        charges 
        It is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the
        Hong Kong Tourist Association  HKTA   identified by a red junk logo 
        Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality
        and service  and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially
        recognized channel for redressing complaints  the number to call is
        Tel  2508 1234  Pick up a copy of HKTA’s “The Official Dining 
        Entertainment & Shopping Directory” in which all member stores are
        listed 
        Shipping  Many stores will pack and ship purchases  Ask if
        automatic free insurance is provided  If the goods are very valuable or
        fragile  it is a good idea to buy an all risk insurance for the
        shipment  Packages sent to the US or to Europe generally take six to
        eight weeks by surface mail  and one week by airmail 
        Shopping Areas  Major shopping areas are Tsim Sha Tsui in
        Kowloon  especially along Nathan Road  Central on Hong Kong Island 
        particularly for upscale designer goods  Causeway Bay for slightly
        better prices  and the Hollywood Road area 
        Department Stores  Look for Lane Crawford Ltd   an upscale
        store with branches at Pacific Place  70 Queen’s Road  and Harbour
        City  Wing On  one of the oldest in Hong Kong  Marks and Spencer  and
        the Japanese department stores  Mitsukoshi  Sobo  and Seibu 
        Malls  Hong Kong is full of giant malls  Harbour City  just
        west of the Star Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui is one of the largest 
        Pacific Place  88 Queensway  is Central’s biggest mall  with retail
        outlets and department stores  Times Square is a collection of retail
        outlets in Causeway Bay  In addition  most top line hotels have upscale
        malls full of designer boutiques 
        Factory Outlets  These stores sell excess stock or factory
        overruns  Hong Kong is no longer a factory outlet center since much of
        its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere  There are factory
        showrooms in the Pedder Building  12 Pedder Street  in Central 
        Markets  Markets are the places to use your bargaining
        skills  Hong Kong’s most famous and colorful market is the Temple
        Street Night Market near the Jordan MTR stop  Every conceivable kind of
        goods is sold here  clothing  all kinds of electronics  CDs  souvenirs 
        crafts  and jewelry 
        Stanley Market is located on Hong Kong’s southern coast 
        and is well known for all kinds of clothing  including silk and
        cashmere  Bargain  and carefully examine any merchandise you buy
        here 
        The Jade Market  on Kansu Street in Yau Ma Tei  is known
        for both jade and freshwater pearls  This is not the place to make
        expensive purchases  but it’s great for inexpensive pendants  earrings 
        and gifts 
        What to Buy
        Antiques  Hollywood Road in the Mid Levels above Central is
        the most famous antiques street in Hong Kong  Look for fine Chinese
        bronzes  embroidery  lacquerware and porcelain  tomb figures  and wood
        carvings  among other possibilities  The experts point out that it is
        not age alone that determines a Chinese antique’s value — the dynasties
        of the past had their creative ups and downs  For serious antiques  try
        Honeychurch Antiques at no  29 for furniture and silver  Tai Sing
        Company at 122 for porcelain  For fun you can visit the Low Price Shop
        at no  47 or the Cat Street crafts stores and flea market 
        Brocades and Silks  Fabrics from China are a bargain and
        well worth taking home  Chinese product department stores stock silk
        fabrics  silk scarves  finely embroidered blouses  and traditional
        padded jackets  Chinese Arts and Crafts is at Pacific Place in Central 
        and in Star House in Tsim Sha Tsui  CRC Department Store is on Hennessy
        Road in Causeway Bay  For fabrics  also try Western Market  Morrison
        Street  in Central 
        Cameras  Photo buffs know that Hong Kong is the place to
        buy some of the world’s most advanced photographic equipment  and there
        are some real bargains around  However  be sure you compare prices and
        models before buying  Two reliable places to start looking in Lan Kwai
        Fong are Photo Scientific in the Eurasia Building and Hing Lee Camera
        Company  25 Lyndhurst Terrace 
        Carpets and Rugs  Hong Kong is a mecca for Chinese
        hand knotted wool carpets and silk rugs  Hong Kong’s stores are usually
        able to arrange shipment  Caravan at 65 Hollywood Road and the shops in
        The Silk Road at Ocean Center in Tsim Sha Tsui are good places to start
        looking 
        China  Porcelain   In Hong Kong you can have a plate  or
        even a whole dinner service  hand painted to your own design  Factories
        in Kowloon and the New Territories  producing traditional and modern
        china  are geared to entertain and instruct visiting tourists  prices
        are appealing  Two of the largest places to go are the Wah Tung China
        Company in the Grand Marine Industrial Building in Aberdeen  and the
        Overjoy Porcelain Factory in Block B of the Kwai Hing Industrial
        Building  Kwai Chung  in the New Territories  In antiques shops  look
        for highly valued porcelains from China  Note that because of the
        duty free situation  good bargains may be found in European china 
        including Spode and Wedgwood 
        Electronics  The latest gadgets are sometimes available in
        Hong Kong before anywhere else  Before you begin shopping  pick up
        HKTA’s “Shopping Guide to Consumer Electronics  ” Prices on electronics
        have risen in the past two years  check prices at home before you buy
        here  Nathan Road has many electronics shops  Also check out Star
        Computer City in the Star House near the Star Ferry terminal 
        Furniture  The choice ranges from traditional hand carved
        Chinese rosewood furniture to well made reproductions of modern Western
        styles  Rattan furniture is highly popular  Hollywood Road has several
        furniture shops  Queen’s Road East in Wan Chai is a furniture
        manufacturing and retail area 
        Jade  “ Good for the health” is just one of the many
        magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald green
        or turquoise stones  Real jade is extremely expensive  and you may be
        offered counterfeit jade  which looks exactly like the genuine article 
        Some people say you can test the authenticity by touch — real jade
        feels smooth and cool  Alternatively  you can shine a lamp on the
        stone — real jade shows no reflected light  Better still  go shopping
        with an expert 
        Jewelry  Thanks to the duty free situation  prices in Hong
        Kong are lower than they are in some other places  You can buy
        gemstones loose or set  or have them made up to your own design 
        Popular purchases include diamonds and freshwater pearls  If you do
        plan to buy jewelry  be sure to consult the “Shopping Guide to
        Jewellery” published by the Hong Kong Tourist Authority to find a
        reputable dealer 
        Kitchen Equipment  Woks and any other gadgets essential for
        Chinese cookery make good purchases  Department stores sell all sorts
        of intriguing kitchen equipment 
        Leather Goods  Leather is not a great bargain in Hong Kong 
        Locally made items do not live up to their European models  However 
        the leather garment industry is growing  and there is a wide range of
        locally produced leather accessories  all at extremely attractive
        prices  For European imports  you will pay top dollar 
        Musical  Audio  and Video Equipment  Hong Kong has a vast
        range of the most high tech audio visual  sound  and screen equipment 
        Before purchasing  visitors should make sure of compatibility with
        systems in their own countries  Be sure to look around and compare
        before buying  Whatever you buy  you may be able to work out a
        discount 
        Ready to wear Clothes  Hong Kong’s shops carry almost every
        recognizable European and many American labels  from top end designers
        to the moderately priced or trendy  Nathan Road  Central  and the hotel
        malls are places to look  There are still a great many factory outlet
        stores with reasonable prices  You’ll also find bargain clothes for
        sale at the markets and on push carts 
        Tailoring  Tailor made clothes are not as popular in Hong
        Kong as they were in the past  but hundreds of shops still remain 
        Local tailors are experts when it comes to producing custom tailored
        garments for both men and women  and are also adept at copying
        patterns  The result can be a quality suit at a fair price — but
        made to measure clothing is not cheap  In choosing a tailor  look for
        HKTA membership  Many tailors have Web sites or are listed on Web
        sites 
        Tea  Shops all over town will sell you gift tins of exotic
        blends  If you want to learn something about tea  go to the Tea Shop at

        Causeway Bay  The owners will brew up a pot so you can taste before
        making a choice 
        Watches  The saying “Time is money” is quite literally true
        in Hong Kong  more is spent on watches and clocks here than on cameras
        and optical goods  An enormous variety of makes and models are on sale 
        Be sure to get the manufacturer’s guarantee stamped or signed if you
        buy a watch

        Kong  and the two other forms  Beijing and Kun  are sometimes
        presented  To most foreigners  this unique art form is likely to be
        inscrutable at first exposure  but everyone can appreciate the
        spectacle and the elaborate  glittering costumes  Although the music
        may seem strange to the unaccustomed ear  it certainly won’t put you to

        all ages  Hong Kong’s many beaches are especially fun for children 
        Children love riding on Hong Kong’s antique trams  A ride on the Peak
        Tram is sure to provide a thrill  and in the Peak Tower they’ll enjoy
        the Peak Explorer ride and Ripley’s Believe it or Not!
        Ocean Park  see page 32  is popular with children of all
        ages  There’s a special Kid’s World that those under 12 can enter free
        when accompanied by a paying adult  The more daring can try out the
        terrifying roller coaster rides 
        Hong Kong’s state of the art interactive museums will
        interest children of all ages  The Science Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui East
        allows children to get their hands on over half of its 500 exhibits 
        while the nearby Space Museum has regular screenings on an enormous
        Omnimax screen in its Space Theater  making the night sky come
        vibrantly alive 
        For children who love boats  riding the Star Ferry or ferry
        trips to outlying islands will be exciting  and the Dolphin Watch trip
         see page 113  is certain to appeal  If you plan to visit during May 
        the carnival atmosphere of the Cheung Chau Bun Festival  with its high
        bamboo and paper towers covered in sticky buns  will fascinate the
        young ones 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        Where to Go
        T he crowded Kowloon peninsula and the booming New
        Territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing  but we
        begin across Victoria Harbor on Hong Kong Island  where the city was
        first founded and which remains the center of government  business  and
        commerce 
        Hong Kong Central
        No matter how many tunnels and transit systems speed
        cross harbor traffic  nothing matches the ride on the Star Ferry from
        Kowloon to the Central District across Victoria Harbor  As the
        double decker boats get ready to leave the pier  bells ring  the
        gangplank is raised  deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers 
        and a couple of hundred commuters begin a seven minute sightseeing
        tour  The big green and white boat weaves its way through an
        ever changing obstacle course of both large and small craft  and the
        soaring skyline of Hong Kong Island draws nearer 
        As you get off  the 52 story Jardine House with
        porthole shaped windows catches the eye  There are restaurants and a
        Starbuck’s in the basement  and you can access the raised pedestrian
        crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor  Next to the Jardine
        building is Exchange Square  a complex with a large shopping mall  just
        behind it is the General Post Office with a philatelic center on the
        ground floor 
        Farther west is the ferry terminal for the outlying islands 
        On Connaught Road Central  you’ll find one of Hong Kong’s curiosities 
        the 244 m   800 ft   long Mid Levels outdoor escalator  It ferries
        commuters from the Mid Levels apartment complexes downhill from 6 to
        10am  and uphill from 10am to midnight  Nearby is Central Market  the
        wholesale food market of Hong Kong  and the Hang Seng building  private
        offices  
        Just east of the Star Ferry terminal  you’ll come to City
        Hall  No longer a center of government  it now functions as a cultural
        center  Go through the underground walkway to Statue Square  on the
        east side of the square is the Legislative Council Building  one of the
        few colonial buildings left in Hong Kong  So great is the pressure on
        the available land that most of Hong Kong’s colonial architectural
        heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers  Despite
        protests by preservationists  there was little alternative 
        Nearby is Chater Garden and a number of notable
        architectural landmarks  Most famous is the striking 74 story I M  Pei
        Bank of China Tower  not beloved by the people of Hong Kong — its
        triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui
         see box  page 68  and its radio masts stick up like an insect’s
        antennae  The rival Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank is by architect Norman
        Foster  built on a “coathanger frame ” its floors hang rather than
        ascend  From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as
        well as the mechanical workings of the building  Two bronze lions 
        carrying out feng shui principles  guard its doors 
        You can catch one of Hong Kong’s historic trams along Des
        Voeux Road and ride from Central to Causeway Bay  see box  page 66   In
        1904  the narrow  double decker trams ran along the waterfront  but
        land reclamation has placed them far inland 
        From the Bank of China Tower  make a short detour up Garden
        Road and turn into Battery Path to reach the landmark St  John’s
        Cathe­dral  Built 1847–1849  this usually deserted Anglican foundation
        is Hong Kong’s oldest church  During World War II  the church was
        turned into a club for Japanese officers  it was restored after the
        war  Note the stained glass windows in the Quiet Chapel  designed by
        Joseph Edward Nuttgens in the late 1950s  Behind the church is the 1917
        French Mission Building  now used as the Court of Final Appeal 
        Across from the I M  Pei tower a winding path leads up to
        Hong Kong Park  The park’s 10 5 hectares  25 acres  of landscaped
        gardens and lakes contains a large greenhouse that holds many species
        of plants  and an aviary of exotic birds  In the park is the Flagstaff
        House Museum of Tea Ware  see page 54   It’s in Hong Kong’s oldest
        colonial building  with exhibits describing the history of tea from the
        Warring States period  475–221 b c    to the present 
        If you leave the park and walk up Cotton Tree Drive  you
        will find the Peak Tram terminal 
        To the Summit
        For more than a century  the most exhilarating way up
        Victoria Peak has been by funicular  The Peak Tram starts its scenic
        climb just across the street and around the corner from the American
        Consulate in Garden Road and makes its way  sometimes at a startlingly
        steep incline  to the summit at 398 m  1 305 ft   The right of way
        travels past fancy apartment blocks  bamboo stands  and jungle flowers 
        Passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor  The
        Peak is still the most fashionable place to live in Hong Kong  but real
        estate prices here are astronomical  rents run around HK$50 000 a
        month 
        The Peak Tram  originally steam powered  was built to speed
        the wealthy taipans to their mountainside retreats  Before the tram was
        built  sedan chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here  Since
        the tram’s inauguration in 1888 it has stopped only for typhoons and
        World War II 
        The modern 120 passenger cars make the journey in around
        eight minutes  However  on sunny Saturdays and Sundays you may have to
        brave a crowd lining up at the lower terminal  During the spring and
        autumn festivals  when people traditionally seek out the hilltops  the
        throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another
        time 
        At the upper terminus there is a four level shopping
        center  the Peak Galleria  and the Peak Tower  which resembles an
        airport control tower and has shops  entertainment  and
        restaurants 
        You can walk around the peak for impressive views of Hong
        Kong  the coastline  and the islands in 45 minutes on Lugard and
        Harlech roads  The view is especially effective at night  There are
        also souvenir stands  benches for a rest  and perhaps Hong Kong’s last
        surviving rickshaws — however these are not for rides  but are a
        tourist photo opportunity  If you’re up to a climb  take the Mount
        Austin road to the Victoria Peak Gardens  These gardens used to belong
        to the governor’s mountain lodge  but the building was demolished by
        the Japanese during the occupation of Hong Kong 
        From the lower terminal of the Peak Tram it’s only a short
        walk to the former governor’s residence  Government House  now a
        museum  Across from the mansion  the Zoological and Botanical Gardens
         gardens open daily 6am–10pm  zoo 6am–7pm  admission free  provide a
        welcome oasis amid the big city pressures  In the very early morning
        the park is taken over by people doing tai chi exercises  Both young
        and old go through ballet like movements in slow motion to discipline
        the mind and body  The park’s zoo has a collection of weird and
        wonderful chattering jungle birds 
        More Hong Kong Island Sights
        Western District
        The Western District is one of Hong Kong’s oldest
        neighborhoods  and its narrow streets hold a collection of fascinating
        traditional shops and enterprises  Opposite the Macau Ferry Terminal
        you’ll find the Western Market  open 10am–7pm   It is more interesting
        for its architecture than for its shopping  it’s situated in a
        four story Edwardian building built in 1906  For an interesting glimpse
        of small and family owned shops  walk along Bonham Strand East and
        West  Man Wa Lane  and Cleverly Street  You’ll find herb and medicine
        shops  incense shops  chop makers’ shops  makers of Chinese seals   and
        more 
        Hong Kong University’s campus is spread along Bonham Road 
        When it opened in 1912  the university had a total of 72 students  At
        the top of a sloping driveway  the stately Edwardian structure that was
        the original university building presides over the institution’s newer
        buildings  The University’s Fung Ping Shan Museum  94 Bonham Road  open
        Monday–Saturday 9 30am–6pm  admission free  holds a significant
        collection of antiquities  bronzes  dating from 3000 b c    and
        ceramics  including Han Dynasty tomb pottery  It also has the world’s
        largest collection of Nestorian crosses from the Yuan Dynasty
        period 
        Around Hollywood Road
        Take the Mid Levels Escalator to Hollywood road  known for
        its antiques and curio shopping  Here the windows and open doors of the
        shops reveal an alluring selection of Asian furniture  carpets 
        carvings  tomb figures  porcelain  and bronze 
        Walk west along Hollywood Road until you come to Man Mo
        Temple  the island’s oldest house of worship  though the date of its
        founding is subject to dispute   Visitors entering the temple are
        confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks
        and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling  these will burn for as
        long as a month   The gold plated sedan chairs on the left hand side of
        the temple were once used for transporting the statues of the temple’s
        gods in religious processions  The statues in the main shrine represent
        Man  the god of literature  and Mo  the god of war  a curious
        juxtaposition  The temple is always crowded with worshipers 
        Just past the temple is the aptly named Ladder Street  Go
        down one flight of steps to Lascar Row  popularly known as Cat Street 
        for more antiques and curio shops  Walk up the steps to reach Caine
        Lane  where you’ll find the Museum of Medical Sciences  open
        Tuesday–Saturday 10am–5pm  admission by donation   The interesting
        Edwardian building was formerly the Pathological Institute  founded to
        combat the 19th century’s 30 year long outbreak of bubonic plague  The
        old laboratory is still intact  and there are exhibits on Chinese
        pharmacology and the history of medicine in Hong Kong 
        Wan Chai
        Just to the east of the financial district  Wan Chai was
        once an area of sleazy clubs and topless bars  this was the setting for
        The World of Suzy Wong  Servicemen relaxing from the rigors of the
        Vietnam War poured millions of dollars into the Wan Chai boom of the
        1960s  There are still bars and clubs here  but the area has become
        almost mainstream  and office towers are replacing many of the sinful
        old premises 
        The Wan Chai waterfront is dominated by the Hong Kong
        Convention and Exhibition Centre  the largest in Asia  which includes
        hotels  theaters  and exhibition halls  The convention center  an
        extension on reclaimed land  affords stunning views of the Wan Chai
        waterfront  Adjacent  just west of the convention center  is another
        modern highlight  the Academy for the Performing Arts on Gloucester
        Road 
        On Wan Chai’s Bowen Road  Maiden’s Rock  also called
        Lover’s Rock  is the gathering place for the annual Maiden’s festival 
        Although it is not a tourist attraction  the rock is steeped in
        tradition  Every August young women convene to light joss sticks and
        some even climb the nine meter  30 ft  rock to pray for good
        husbands 
        Causeway Bay
        About 2 km  a mile  east of Wan Chai  Causeway Bay is
        second only to Tsim Sha Tsui as Hong Kong’s place to shop  A prosperous
        tourist district  it is full of shopping centers and department stores 
        along with a number of good restaurants  The busy night and day crowds
        make this area vibrant and lively 
        On the nautical side is the Causeway Bay typhoon shelter 
        where expensive yachts are anchored almost gunwale to gunwale  and the
        Hong Kong Yacht Club has its headquarters  Across Gloucester Road 
        opposite the World Trade Centre  is the Noonday Gun  which under
        British rule was sounded on the stroke of midday  Silent for a time 
        the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction  It’s not
        clear how the custom started  One story has it that traders Jardine 
        Matheson & Co fired a private salute for a visiting tycoon  an act
        that incensed the colonial authorities  who felt that they had the sole
        right to issue such a 21 gun welcome  As a result  the merchants were
        forced to limit their salvoes to one a day — and from then on  they
        signaled the noon hour daily for all to hear  The gun was made famous
        by Noel Coward’s satirical song  “Mad Dogs and Englishmen  ”
        Farther east is Hong Kong’s largest park  Victoria Park 
        with sports grounds and other facilities  On the eastern side of
        Victoria Park on Causeway Road is Tin Hau Temple  dedicated to Tin Hau 
        the Taoist Queen of Heaven and patroness of seafarers  Originally the
        temple was on the shore but reclamation projects have now left it high
        and dry  On the 23rd day of the Third Moon  the birthday of the goddess
        is celebrated here and in all Hong Kong fishing communities 
        Inland from the bay is Happy Valley  At one time it was a
        very miserable valley  a swampland conducive only to breeding malarial
        mosquitoes  It is home to Hong Kong’s first racetrack  Hong Kong’s
        gamblers are so eager to play the horses that  despite the opening of a
        bigger and better racetrack at Sha Tin  the Happy Valley Racecourse is
        thriving 
        Up Tai Hang Road behind Causeway Bay is Aw Boon Haw  Tiger
        Balm  Gardens  open daily 9 30am–4pm   founded in 1935 by the late Aw
        Boon Haw  who became a millionaire by producing the medicinal Tiger
        Balm   It does not  in fact  contain any ingredients from tigers  but
        does promise to cure a wide range of problems such as colds  headaches 
        rheumatism  gout  toothache  and scorpion bites    With its garish
        pagodas  artificial caves  and brightly painted statues of well known
        Taoist and Buddhist legends  the garden is an obvious photo
        opportunity 
        around the Coast
        Aberdeen  the island’s oldest settlement  once a pirate
        lair  is home to the “floating population” — the boat people who spend
        their entire lives on the junks in the harbor  some proudly claiming
        never to have set foot on land  except for funerals  which don’t
        count   The junks are a picturesque sight  children frolicking on the
        poop deck  women preparing food or playing mah jong  elderly folk
        watching the sunset  dogs and cats underfoot  songbirds in bamboo cages
        overhead — and all afloat 
        The boats may appear deceptively primitive  but many of
        them have their own electric generators and all the modern
        conveniences  There are fewer boats now than in the past  many boat
        people  especially the younger generation  have moved to housing
        projects  You can take a tour of the port in one of the small sampans 
        propelled by hand by women drivers  A half hour tour costs HK$50  pay
        at the end  or the driver may cut your trip short 
        Aberdeen’s theatrical floating restaurants have been a
        tourist attraction for many years  The food may not live up to
        expectations  but the fantasy environment makes up for it  If you can
        get up early enough  you can attend the pre dawn auction held at the
        vast local wholesale fish market  otherwise  have a look at the street
        market that goes on later in the day 
        The peninsula opposite the east coast of Ap Lei Chau island
        contains Ocean Park  open daily 10am–6pm  admission HK$150 adults

        The Oceanarium is said to be the largest in the world  and
        the Ocean Theatre features displays by dolphins  killer whales  seals 
        and pelicans  An enormous roller coaster rising way above the sea 
        space wheels  and high diving shows guarantee a day of excitement  The
        Middle Kingdom is a recreated “living” history of China’s past 
        presented through a number of full size replicas of shrines  temples 
        pagodas  palaces  and street scenes  There are also demonstrations of
        traditional Chinese crafts  including silk weaving  pottery  and p
        apermaking  Water World  formerly in the complex  has closed for
        redevelopment 
        Continuing around the coast in a counter clockwise
        direction  Deep Water Bay offers a good beach and harbors  The next
        inlet is Repulse Bay  a roomy  sandy crescent  with green hills  It’s
        so attractive and so easy to reach that it’s packed with sunbathers all
        summer long 
        Stanley was once one of the main fishing villages on Hong
        Kong Island  The well known Stanley Mar­ket  see page 55  is a major

        favorite place of residence for ex pats  The waterfronts at Repulse Bay
        and Stanley are lined with good cafés and restaurants 
        Kowloon
        Though much smaller than Hong Kong Island  Kowloon has
        almost twice the population  In many areas  the density reaches the
        equivalent of 150 000 inhabitants per square km  a quarter square
        mile  
        Most of Kowloon’s attractions for visitors are centered
        near the tip of the peninsula in the district known as Tsim Sha Tsui 
        Adjacent to the Star Ferry terminal is Ocean Terminal  where
        international cruise ships dock  and the gigantic Harbour City  a
        complex of malls  hotels  and restaurants 
        If you walk east on the Star Ferry terminal concourse  you
        will find yourself on the wonderful Promenade  which begins at the
        clock tower  all that remains of the once grand Kowloon Canton Railway
        Terminus  The waterfront here offers unparalled views of the harbor and
        Hong Kong Island  If you continue to the end of the promenade  you will
        be in Tsim Sha Tsui East  a busy commercial district built on more than
        60 hectares  150 acres  of reclaimed land 
        Flanked by the clock tower is the imposing Hong Kong

        tower  Its restored lobby is Hong Kong’s most elegant gathering place 
        afternoon tea here is a visitors’ ritual 
        Alongside the hotel runs busy Nathan Road  Hong Kong’s
        fabled shopping street  lined with shops  hotels  and restaurants 
        Kowloon’s main street was created by Sir Matthew Nathan when he was
        governor of Hong Kong at the turn of the 19th century  At the time it
        was built  many thought it absurd to have a tree lined boulevard
        running through what was practically a wilderness  Now the former
        “Nathan’s Folly” is known as the “Golden Mile  ”
        A few blocks up Nathan Road is Kowloon Park  open daily
        6am–midnight   elegantly laid out with fountains  promenades  and

        to find the Jade Market  open 10am–3pm  see page 80   with more than
        100 stalls spread out in a large tent  just before you reach the

        Hong Kong’s liveliest market scene is the Temple Street
        Night Market  see page 55   near Jordan Road  Everything is sold here 
        from clothing to souvenirs to electronic goods  and the market is known
        for its street side food stalls  where you can dine inexpensively on
        seafood  The market runs all the way up to Tin Hau Temple  where you
        will find fortune tellers’ tables  some speak English  and possibly
        street performers singing Chinese opera or pop songs  The temple is one
        of the many dedicated to Tin Hau  goddess of seafarers  this one also
        houses an altar to Shing Wong  the city’s god  In the daytime the
        temple  open 8am–6pm  attracts worshipers  and its park attracts
        strollers and mah jong players 
        Nathan Road goes all the way up to Boundary Street  which
        marks the boundary between Kowloon and the New Territories  Near
        Boundary Street  off Prince Edward Street West  is the Yuen Po Street
        Bird Garden  open 8am–7pm   Birds are favorite pets in Hong Kong 
        valued for their singing rather than their plumage  and here you’ll
        find all kinds of birds for sale as well as elaborate teak and bamboo
        cages 
        Off the beaten path in Sham Shui Po  west of the junction
        of Nathan Road and Boundary Street  is the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb and
        Museum on Tonkin Road  open Monday–Wednesday and Friday–Saturday
        10am–6pm  Sunday 1–6pm  closed Thursday   This ancient burial vault is
        believed to date back to the Han Dynasty  a d  25–220   The
        barrel vaulted chambers were discovered while excavating for a nearby
        housing project 
        New Territories
        Hong Kong’s New Territories begin at Boundary Street 
        Surprises spring up on all sides  new industrial complexes alongside
        sleepy farming villages  skyscraper towns blooming in the middle of
        nowhere  Hakka women in their traditional flat straw hats with hanging
        black curtains  water buffalo  and flashes of azalea everywhere 
        The New Territories can be explored by taking the
        Kowloon–Canton Railway  KCR   which makes 10 stops between the station
        in Kowloon and Sheung Shui  the last stop before entering China  Ask
        the tourist authority about its interesting Heritage Tour from Kowloon
        and other countryside tours  see page 113  
        The main highway makes a circuit of the New Territories 
        beginning with the new town of Tsuen Wan  situated in an area of heavy
        industry just west of Kowloon  North of the town  a commanding view
        over all the New Territories to the north can be seen from Tai Mo Shan 
        Hong Kong’s highest peak at 957 m  3 140 ft   The highway continues
        parallel to the coast  One third of all Hong Kong’s beaches are to be
        found in a single 14 km  9 mile  stretch of this region’s shoreline 
        Place names are often based on the distance to the nearest mile post 
        as measured from the tip of the Kowloon peninsula  Thus you will find
        “191 2 mile Beach” at Castle Peak Bay 
        The main road continues clockwise around the New
        Territories  As you approach the border  you can glimpse the
        skyscrapers of Shenzhen  The lookout point at Lok Ma Chau was once
        known as Hong Kong’s “window on China” — in the years of China’s
        isolation from the West  tourists would come to the lookout point here
        and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery
        beyond 
        Set amid Tseun Wan’s residential towers is the 18th century
        walled village of Sam Tung Uk  now preserved as a museum  and a short
        walk from the MTR station  Not far away  at milepost 21 near the large
        new town of Tuen Mun  is a Taoist retreat known as Ching Chung Koon 
        This “Temple of Green Pines” is a spacious complex containing temples
        and pavilions  statues  and gardens  It is known for its collection of
        bonsai and houses a jade seal more than 1 000 years old  Among the
        ponds is one inhabited by turtles  Visitors toss in coins in the hope
        of bouncing one off a turtle’s head  a sure way of achieving good
        fortune 
        An even more interesting image out of Chinese history is
        the walled village of Kat Hing Wai  in the village of Kam Tin just
        outside the market town of Yuen Long  This is the most easily
        accessible of the New Territories’ walled villages  It is built in a
        square  and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive
        wall  Kat Hing Wai was built four or five centuries ago by the Hakka
        Tang clan  one of the Five Great Clans that migrated here from North
        China  see page 11   Many of the old houses in the village have been
        replaced by modern structures 
        The Tang clan’s earliest walled village was Lo Wai  which
        also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate 
        Adjacent to the village is the restored Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall 
        Few traditional ancestral halls remain in China since the
        anti historical destruction during the Cultural Revolution  so these
        New Territories ancestral halls are rare survivors  Another such hall 
        belonging to the Liu Clan  is Liu Man Shek Tong in the village of
        Sheung Shui 
        One of the most interesting sites in the New Territories is
        Tai Fu Tai  another rare survivor  this one a mansion that belonged to
        a Confucian high official  The house was built in 1865 by a member of
        the Man clan who achieved the rank of tai fu  mandarin  by doing well
        in the Imperial Exam­inations  The preservation of this wonderful home
        is ongoing  a projected restoration of the original garden is still in
        progress  The traditional Qing Dyna­sty style of the mansion is
        enlivened by a few West­ern touches  a Baroque style ceiling and
        stained glass above the doorways  showing the builder’s up to date
        attitude at the time of construction 
        The highway and the railway stay close together from
        Fanling  site of the best golf courses in the area  Tai Po  just south
        of Fanling  is known for its market  Tai Po Market  which buzzes with
        activity daily from 7am to 6pm  Just up a lane from the market is the
        Man Mo Temple  with long burning incense coils hanging from its
        ceiling  a popular spot dedicated to the Taoist gods of war and
        literature 
        The railway line then curves gracefully around Tolo Harbor 
        an idyllic body of water well protected from the open sea  You can take
        a ferryboat through the harbor  past the ingenious Plover Cove
        reservoir  a water catchment area appropriated by damming and draining
        a broad inlet from the sea  The boats go on to the friendly fishermen’s
        island of Tap Mun  in Mirs Bay  with stops in remote hamlets of the Sai
        Kung Peninsula  The Sai Kung area is the location of two official parks
        and nature preserves  while on the south side of the peninsula are some
        of the territory’s best beaches 
        From the next railway station  the modern campus of the
        Chinese University of Hong Kong is visible  Teaching here is conducted
        in both Chinese and English  The Art Gallery in the Institute of
        Chinese Studies Building is worth a visit for its painting and
        calligraphy collections 
        Sha Tin is the site of the Monastery of 10 000 Buddhas 
        which looks down on a burgeoning town  There are hundreds of stone
        steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach Man Fat Temple with
        its regiments of small gilt statues of Buddha lining the walls  Some
        indefatigable climbers will want to go up to the top of the nine story
        pink pagoda for a panoramic view  There is a total of 12 800 Buddha
        statues here  plus the remains of the monastery’s founder embalmed in
        gold leaf  Also here is the Hongkong Heritage Museum  call Tel  2180
        8188 for open hours   The museum has an art collection  and displays of
        toys and other artifacts 
        Down to earth  the Sha Tin Racecourse can accommodate over
        80 000 spectators and is equipped with every imaginable luxury 
        including a giant video screen facing the stands  and for the horses 
        air conditioned stables  Opposite the Sha Tin railway station  New Town
        Plaza features shops  cinemas  and even a computer controlled musical
        fountain 
        Two natural rock formations are always pointed out on
        excursions  Sha Tin Rock  better known as Amah Rock  is actually a pile
        of several rocks that resemble a woman with a baby in a sling on her
        back  Legend has it that a local woman climbed the hill every day to
        watch for her husband returning from across the sea  one day the wife
        and her child were turned to stone as a permanent symbol of her
        enduring faith  Closer to town is Lion Rock  shaped like a lion lying
        in wait  It really looks the part  the tourists know its name even
        before the guide can translate it 
        The Islands
        Excursion companies sell a variety of orientation cruises
        of Hong Kong harbor that include a look at some of its 235 outlying
        islands  These pleasant  but expensive  outings can lay the foundation
        for your own explorations aboard the cheap but usually comfortable
        ferries used by the islanders themselves  From the ferry terminals on
        Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares  where
        the local people smile “hello” and  if you’re lucky  point you to a
        secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time  For ferry

        Lantau Island
        The mountainous island of Lantau is the biggest in the
        colony  and covers nearly twice the area of Hong Kong Island  Chek Lap
        Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau  plans to build a
        bridge may change Lantau  but at present it is sparsely populated and
        makes a perfect getaway 
        At 934 m  3 064 ft   Lantau Peak is high enough to attract
        the occasional rain cloud — refreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot
        summer days  More than half the island is parkland  and there is a
        70 km  45 mile  circular hiking trail  see page 92   Ferries depart
        from Central every two hours between 6 10am and 10 30pm to Silvermine
        Bay  Mui Wo   where a bus terminal has buses to all parts of the
        island  There are also ferries to Discovery Bay 
        A short bus ride away is Cheung Sha Beach  3 km  2 miles 
        long  and popular for its white sand and excellent facilities 
        The most famous site on the island is the world’s tallest
        seated bronze statue of Buddha at 22 m  72 6 ft   the Tiantan Buddha
         see page 55   The statue and a small museum are on a peak  up 268
        steps  above Po Lin Monastery  The monastery is strictly vegetarian 
        and visitors are warned not to bring any meat with them  You can have a
        delicious vegetarian lunch here 
        From the monastery  hikers enjoy the two hour cross country
        trek down to Silvermine Bay  but the authorities have warned walkers to
        be on the lookout for snakes  which can be plentiful in the Lantau
        hinterland  especially in summer  The hillsides that surround the
        monastery are the site of Hong Kong’s only tea plantation  Visitors are
        welcome to visit the 24 hectare  60 acre  establishment  and may sample
        the end product  Lantau tea 
        The island’s largest community is Tai O  The people of this
        picturesque village make their living by fishing  duck breeding  and
        food processing  Many of the inhabitants live — by choice  not
        necessarily through economic hardship — on the water  aboard houseboats
        or in houses on stilts in the main creek 
        A Trappist monastery  situated on a hillside overlooking
        the east coast of Lantau  is also open to visitors  To get here  follow
        the path from the southwest end of Discovery Bay  the walk takes about
        30 minutes 
        Cheung Chau
        Some 10 km  6 miles  west of Hong Kong lies this small 
        crowded island  only one square mile in size  More than 25 000 people
        live here  mostly by fishing  but there are also ex pats  attracted by
        its laid back Mediterranean ambience  The island has a checkered past
        of smuggling and pira cy  That era is gone now  but other elements of
        the island’s old life are preserved  The people still carve jade and
        build seaworthy junks  all by hand  Fish  heads discreetly wrapped in
        paper  are still hung out to dry in the sun 
        Cheung Chau becomes the center of Hong Kong life once a
        year  usually in May  during the Bun Festival  a folklore extravaganza
         see page 89   The rest of the year  life goes on at its accustomed
        pace  rickety machines chugging in two man factories  children in
        school uniforms being ferried home to houseboats  and the old fishermen
        stirring shrimp paste 
        By way of formal tourist attractions  Pak Tai Temple  built
        in 1783  has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 600
        years old  But the most interesting thing to do here is to explore the
        two villages on the island  Cheung Chau and San Wai  They are an easy
        walk apart by the harbor road  or a longer 45 minute hike on the scenic
        Peak Road  The Praya  the promenade in front of the ferry pier  is a
        good place to observe the many junks and fishing boats in the harbor 
        There are also several open air restaurants where you can enjoy fresh
        seafood 
        Lamma Island
        Only 35 minutes by ferry from Central  Lamma Island is
        perfect for swimming  hiking  picnicking  birdwatching  or just sitting
        back to watch the bananas grow  Hong Kong’s third largest island has a
        population of only about 12 000  it is still largely undeveloped  and
        life on Lamma  if not totally primitive  is close to the essentials 
        Archaeologists indicate that Lamma has probably been inhabited for some
        4 000 years  and the island is known as “Hong Kong’s Stone Age Island 
        ”
        The principal settlements are Yung Shue Wan on Lamma’s
        northwest  and Sok Kwu Wan  on the east coast  Both villages offer good
        waterfront restaurants with homestyle Chinese food  principally seafood
        fresh from the tank  The ports are within hiking distance of several
        beautiful beaches  and within a one hour hike of each other on a marked
        trail  You can build an appetite for dinner by making your way from the
        beach to the restaurant  Yung Shue Wan is still a very British
        residential enclave  with many nice pubs 
        An Excursion to Macau
        Macau  the final bastion of Portugal’s great 16th century
        empire  is much more than just a quirk of history  Here  where East and
        West first met  life combines the spirit of Asia with something of the
        sunny atmosphere of the Mediterranean 
        Macau’s historic center  with its colonial architecture 
        has a distinctly Medit­er­ranean flavor  Col­­o­n­na­­ded public
        buildings  iron balconies  winding streets  flagstoned squares and the
        many churches all speak of the Portuguese inheritance as well as the
        Chinese  a fusion of East and West that has produced the unique
        Macanese culture 
        The story of the Western discovery of Macau begins in 1513
        when Portuguese explorer  Jorge Alvares  reached the south coast of
        China  Traders followed in his wake  setting up bases in several parts
        of the Pearl River estuary  Finally  in 1557  they were all
        consolidated in Macau  It was the only European gateway to China  and
        through Macau flowed Western technology and religion  In 1576 Pope
        Gregory XIII created the Macau diocese  covering all of China and
        Japan 
        No less impressive were the secular challenges  China and
        Japan were not on speaking terms  so trade between them had to be
        channeled through a neutral middleman  Lucky Macau fit the
        specifications exactly  Portugal’s resulting near monopoly of East–West
        trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other
        European powers  The Dutch sent an invasion flotilla to Macau in 1622 
        but the defenders triumphed  However  the end of the golden age was
        drawing near  China began to relax trade restrictions  and with the
        rise of Hong Kong  Macau became an isolated Portuguese outpost 
        A haven for persecuted Japanese Christians in the 17th
        century  Portugal’s neutrality during World War II assured the
        territory a flood of refugees  They were joined by a swarm of spies of
        all conceivable nationalities  and Macau won a name for international
        intrigue 
        Portugal’s very precarious foothold on the Asian coast
        ended in 1999 with a formal handover to China  Macau  now the Chinese
        Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai  is becoming something like a boomtown
        as an exporter of toys  furniture  and electronics  New construction in
        the past 10 years has changed the city’s skyline  with new  glittering
        hotels and highrise apartment blocks  the city is beginning to look a
        little more like Hong Kong 
        Macau’s population is estimated at around 450 000  an
        appallingly high figure for such a small area  recent land reclamation
        has eased the situation to some extent  If a trace of tropical lethargy
        still adds to the charm in this city of sidewalk cafés  palm trees  and
        pedicabs  any torpor definitely ends once inside the doors of Macau’s
        casinos  scene of some of the liveliest gambling west of Las Vegas 
        Gambling provides almost 40 percent of the government’s tax revenues 
        and is a major source of employment  Its spin off industries 
        prostitution and pawn shops  also thrive 
        Arriving
        The easiest way to get to Macau is by jetfoil  operated by
        TurboJet  Tel  2859 3333   The 40 mile trip takes about an hour 
        Departures are from the Macau Ferry Terminal  just west of Central in
        the Shun Tak Centre  200 Connaught Road  Central  in Hong Kong 
        Jetfoils leave every 15 to 30 minutes 24 hours a day 
        Entry procedures are similar to those in Hong Kong — most
        nationalities need only a passport to enter Macau  Macau’s own
        currency  the pataca  is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar  and you can
        use your Hong Kong currency freely in Macau 
        Upon arrival in Macau  be sure to stop by the Macau
        Government Tourist Office for a map  brochures  and directions  Outside
        the terminal  you will find taxis as well as buses to all points  take
        3  3A  10  or 10A to the historic center  exact change is required  
        You’ll also be approached by pedicab drivers  these are tricycles
        carrying two passengers  Pedicabs were once the most common form of
        transportation in Macau  but today they are mainly a tourist
        attraction 
        Sights in Macau
        Directly across the street from the wharf where passengers
        arrive from Hong Kong is the first surprise to greet visitors to
        Macau — the vast Jai alai Palace  said to be the world’s most luxurious

        fine example of colonial architecture  On the inside walls are flowered
        blue tiles  azulejos  and coats of arms  The inscription over the
        archway reads  “Cidade do nome de Deus  não ha outra mais leal”  “City
        of the Name of God  None is More Loyal”  — a bit of praise attributed
        to Portugal’s King John IV in the 17th century  For all its historic
        grandeur  the loyal Senate now is the equivalent of a city council  its
        statesmanship dedicated to water supplies  sewage lines  and the
        establishment of playgrounds 
        Macau’s most memorable monument is the Baroque façade of
        the ruins of São Paulo  the only remains of a beautiful 17th century
        Jesuit church  On top of a hill in the center of the city  it’s
        approached by a grand staircase  The rest of the building and an
        adjoining college were destroyed in a typhoon fanned fire in 1835  The
        rich sculptural effects on the façade mix Eastern and Western symbols 
        familiar saints  Chinese dragons  and a Portuguese caravel  Beneath the
        church  the Museum of Sacred Art houses a collection of sacramental
        objects

        overview of Macau’s history and its daily life and traditions  A
        re created street of colonial Macau is lined with traditional Chinese
        shops  The fort  built by the Jesuits in the 17th century as a defense
        against the Dutch  was largely destroyed by the same fire that burned

        Luís Vaz de Camões  1524–1580   the Portuguese national
        poet whose work immortalized that country’s golden age of discoveries

        great saga  Os Lusíadas  in what is now called the Camões Grotto 
        situated in the spacious tropical Camões Garden 
        Next to the museum  behind a gate  opened to anyone who

        Chinese viceroy from Canton and the minister plenipotentiary of the
        United States of America  put their names to a historic document — the
        first ever treaty between the two countries 
        Another important ceremony took place in 1999 when Macau

         properly called Ma Kok Temple  open daily dawn to dusk   dedicated to
        the favorite goddess of fishermen  who is also known as Tin Hau  The

        rampant on Wanchai island  just a swim away  the image of St  James is
        said to have stepped down from the altar and halted an invasion  Part
        of the fortress has been converted and is now used as a luxury inn  The
        northernmost point in Macau is the frontier between two contrasting
        worlds  The Barrier Gate  Portas do Cerco   which was built more than a
        century ago  marks the boundary between the enclave of Macau and the
        People’s Republic of China

        Like Hong Kong  Macau is a duty free port  It is famous
        for its gold jewelry  Market prices per tael  34 grams 1 2 ounces  of
        gold are set daily  You should always ask for a certificate of
        guarantee when you buy gold or jewelry  Look for jewelry shops along
        Avenida do Infante D  Henrique and Avenida de Almei­da Ribeiro 
        Browsing is a real pleasure in Macau’s main streets and
        byways  where shops aimed at the tourist market are interspersed with
        the more workaday ironmongers  herbalists  and noodle stalls 
        Knowle­dgeable visitors look for antiques — either Chinese heirlooms or
        leftovers from the gracious Portuguese colonial days  However  you are
        not likely to find bargains  and you should be aware that unless you
        are an expert  you can end up with a fake  Also worth investigating are
        contemporary handicrafts  both Portuguese and Chinese  from across the
        border 
        Food and Drink
        Gourmets award Macau high marks for dependable Chinese
        cooking with an exotic bonus  Portuguese food and wines  Macau’s own

        hearty red Dão or Colares  After dinner  a glass of Madeira or port is
        recommended to round off the meal  The more abstemious can stick to
        Portuguese mineral water 
        Taipa and Coloane
        Bridges link Macau with its two islands  Since the
        construction of the New Macau Taipa Bridge has allowed easy access to
        the airport  the population has grown to more than 30 000  with
        industrial development  new apartment blocks  and luxury resort
        hotels 
        The quaint Taipa Village  with its narrow lanes and
        colonial buildings painted yellow  blue  and green  has almost been
        completely swallowed up by the development of nearby housing projects 
        The island is also the designated home of the University of East Asia 
        Pay a visit to the Casa Museu da Taipa  and you’ll be able to get a
        glimpse of how Macanese families lived in former days  A grand colonial
        house  fully restored and outfitted with period furnishings  provides
        the centerpiece for this expanding “cultural village  ”
        Farther away is Coloane  connected to Taipa by a causeway
        and a large land reclamation project  Not as developed as Taipa  it
        offers the joys of sand and sea and is known for its beaches  Cheoc Van
        and Hac Sa  “Black Sands”  are both popular resort areas  with
        lifeguards on duty in summer and windsurfing boards for rent  There are
        restaurants  swimming pools  and changing facilities  The village of
        Coloane is picturesque  with a central square lined with cafés  The
        waterfront drive parallels the shore of a Chinese island  and boats
        headed to China pass through the narrow waterway  The small Chapel of
        St  Francis Xavier is dedicated to the 16th century patron saint of
        missionaries  and has on display the elbow of the saint  along with the
        bones of numerous Japanese and Vietnamese martyrs 
        Seac Pai Van Park  on the west coast of the island is an
        interesting natural preserve with aNatural History Museum 
        An Excursion to Guangzhou  Canton 
        Guangzhou was China’s major seaport for 2 000 years and
        the center for European traders in the 19th century  The city still
        maintains its important gateway role  Ever since 1957 the Canton Trade
        Fair  officially the Chinese Export Commodities Fair  has attracted
        throngs of international business people every spring and autumn 
        Guangzhou  with a population of more than 5 million 
        straddles the Pearl River — China’s fifth longest — which links the
        city to the South China Sea  This waterway accounts for much of the
        local charm and excitement  as the daily drama of the ferryboats 
        junks  sampans  freighters — and even small tankers and big
        gunboats — unfolds right in the center of town  The river also
        irrigates the carefully tended surrounding farmlands  creating a
        beautifully lush  subtropical scene  Guangdong Province has some of
        China’s most fertile land  and grows two crops of rice a year  along
        with vegetables of all kinds 
        Guangzhou today is mostly about business and industry 
        featuring new development  skyscrapers  a whole new business area  and
        raised expressways  The scary traffic is a real experience — vehicles
        of all kinds jockey for position on crowded streets  missing each other
        by inches  and speeding on the freeways is rampant  Guangzhou is
        interestingly one of China’s most prosperous cities  determinedly on
        the move into the modern world  It seems that the picturesque older
        sections with their old houses  narrow streets  and winding alleyways
        may not be around much longer 
        Arriving in Guangzhou
        There are many package tours to Guangzhou from Hong Kong
         see page 113   and this may be the easiest way to visit the city 
        However  it’s also easy to get to Guangzhou by train or ferry  Four
        comfortable express trains depart the Kowloon Canton Railway  KCR 
        Station in Hung Hom  Kowloon  making the trip in less than two hours

        contributions from overseas Chinese  The center of the park is the Five
        Rams Statue  It celebrates the founding of Guangzhou  when five spirits
        rode their goats down from the celestial realm to present the
        inhabitants of the city with their very first grains of rice 
        Guangzhou’s most important Buddhist monument is the
        1 400 year old Temple of the Six Banyan Trees  open 8am–5pm   Although
        the banyan trees that once flourished here are now no more  the
        often restored complex has remained a focus of local Buddhist
        activities  Golden Buddha statues in several of Buddha’s aspects adorn
        the temples  and overlooking them is the 17 story Flower Pagoda  a
        slender relic of the Song dynasty  a d  960–1279  
        In the early Middle Ages  Canton had a significant Muslim
        population as a result of its trade with the Middle East  This explains
        the presence in Guangzhou of the Huaisheng Mosque  reputed to be
        China’s oldest  and traditionally dated a d  627  Rebuilt in modern
        times  the mosque serves the small local community of Muslims  The
        modern minaret is known as the “Plain  or Naked  Pagoda ” in contrast
        to the Flower Pagoda of the Buddhist temple 
        Chen Jia Ci  the Chen Family Institute  open daily
        8 30am–5pm   was built in the late 19th century to promote arts and
        crafts  An architectural wonder  it is itself a beautiful piece of
        craftsmanship with its sculpture and carved stone balustrades 
        Porcelain friezes adorn the rooftops and ridgepoles  telling the story
        of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms  Inside is a collection of
        ceramics  carvings  and furniture  There is also a market and a
        porcelain shop 
        A former Confucian temple is presently the home of the
        historic National Peasant Movement Institute  where the Chinese
        Communist Party trained its leaders in the 1920s  Mao Zedong himself
        directed the institute in 1926  and gave lectures on geography  rural
        education  and “The Problem of the Chinese Peasantry  ” Zhou Enlai also
        taught here 
        The atmosphere of 19th century Canton is best evoked on
        Shamian Island  a haunting  nostalgic place in the Pearl River  This
        small formerly residential island  beautifully shaded by banyan trees 
        was the home of the closed community of the foreign colony in the era
        of “concessions  ” The bridges were barred by night with iron gates to
        keep the Chinese out  Its stately European style buildings have since
        been restored  largely for use as government offices and foreign
        legations  The island also has Guangzhou’s first modern luxury resort
        hotel 
        A popular optional excursion is an hour’s detour to
        Guangzhou Zoo  founded in 1958  It houses more than 200 animal species

        market  Qing Ping  Guangzhou is famous for its food  The Cantonese love
        to eat and have the reputation of eating almost anything that walks on
        four legs  The market bears this out  Along with the usual ducks and
        chickens  you will see for sale snakes  dogs  bats  and sometimes
        monkeys — all are highly prized as delicacies  More pleasantly  you can
        browse among lanes of antiques  flowers  herbs  fruit  goldfish 
        songbirds  and more 
        A Side Trip to Foshan
        A very popular day trip from Guangzhou goes to Foshan  a
        city of nearly 300 000 people  renowned for its handicrafts for more
        than a thousand years  The individual artisans’ shops are no longer

        An Excursion to Shenzhen
        Shenzhen was China’s first Special Economic Zone 
        Literally created out of rural farmland  it was set up in the 1970s as
        the answer to Hong Kong  From a population of 20 000 it has grown into
        a metropolis of 2 5 million  with tightly clustered skyscrapers and
        some of China’s highest grossing industries 
        Because Shenzhen is much cheaper than Hong Kong  it is a
        popular weekend destination for Hong Kong’s Chinese  who come to relax 
        dine in its resorts  and play golf — Shenzhen hosted the World Cup of
        Golf in 1995  It is even becoming something of a commuter town — owning
        or renting an apartment here costs a fraction of what it would in Hong
        Kong 
        Shenzhen is easy to reach — the KCR commuter train runs
        throughout the day  the trip taking about 40 minutes  Visitors need a
        visa to enter China  and must disembark at the border  now called
        “boundary”  checkpoint  Lo Wai  City buses also go to Shenzhen  A Turbo
        Cat ferry makes a one hour trip  7am–7pm  from Hong Kong’s Macau Ferry
        Terminal to Shekou on the Natau Peninsula  which is part of the
        economic zone 
        Shenzhen is a premier shopping center  and much cheaper
        than Hong Kong  It is known for its inexpensive  but well made 
        knock off designer goods  You can use your Hong Kong dollars here  so
        there’s no need to change currency  Some places take credit cards  but
        cash is better for bargaining  Just across the border is the huge Lo Wu
        City shopping mall  to which you can walk  other shopping malls are
        nearby 
        Shenzhen’s main tourist attractions are its enormous theme
        parks  One of them — Splendid China — purports to show “all of China in
        one day  ” It contains elaborate replicas of China’s chief monuments in
        impressive detail  including a scaled down version of the Great Wall 
        The 24 China Folk Culture Villages represent China’s ethnic variety 
        they feature craftspeople in traditional costumes along with folksong
        and dance performances

        Xian’s terra cotta warriors 
      
    
  


  
  
    
      
        A Brief History
        Jerusalem’s recorded history begins with its mention in
        Egyptian court records 4 000 years ago  but there had been human
        settlements here for centuries  probably millennia  before that  At the
        beginning of the second millennium b c    Jerusalem was a Canaanite
        mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route  far less important than
        biblical cities such as Hazor  Megiddo  Beth Shean  and Shechem  The
        earliest name associated with the city  Ur usalim  perhaps meant “city
        of Shalim” or “founded by Shalim  ” Scholars speculate that Shalim
        might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace  for the name
        resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for “peace”  shalom and
        salaam  respectively  If true  this is an ironic name for a city that
        would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places
        on the face of the earth 
        Biblical Jerusalem
        In the Bible  Genesis 14 18–20 records that Abraham visited
        the city of “Salem” in approximately 1800 b c  and was blessed by the
        city’s ruler  Melchzedik  who offered him bread and wine  The city is
        not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet
        warrior  King David  who captured the city from the Jebusites in about
        1000 b c  The Bible describes how David’s soldiers conquered Jerusalem
        by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the
        city by surprise  Warren’s Shaft  part of a Canaanite water system
        discovered by 19th century archaeologists and open to visitors  might
        be the very tunnel infiltrated by David’s army 
        Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not
        allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel  David made it the
        capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented
        artisans  dedicated priests  magical poets and musicians  and the most
        formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city  He
        also brought the Ark of the Covenant  the portable tabernacle
        containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai  to the
        Spring of Gihon  just outside the walls of Jerusalem  There the Ark
        rested until it was placed in the Temple  built in approximately 960
        b c  on Mt  Moriah  the high point at the northern end of the city 
        The Temple  today known as the “First” Temple  was completed
        by David’s son and successor  King Solomon  According to biblical
        tradition  although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully
        assembled its building materials  he was deemed unworthy of
        constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his
        hands  At the Temple’s dedication  Solomon addressed his God  “    the
        Heavens  even the Heaven of the Heavens  cannot contain Thee  how much
        less this House that I have built? ”
        The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt 
        Moriah  on which it stood  where Abraham was called to sacrifice his
        son Isaac  Along with this splendid house of worship  Solomon built a
        royal palace  mansions for his wives  temples for the foreign gods
        worshipped by the princesses he had married  and towers for the defense
        of the capital  Under the wise reign of Solomon  the city flourished as
        the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea
        and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia  The Temple and
        royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with
        cedar from Lebanon  the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon
        have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3 000 years  But with
        his death the empire collapsed  and the Israelite kingdom was divided
        into two separate  impoverished  often warring nations  Israel  with
        its capital at Shechem in the north  ruled by a series of northern
        dynasties  and the smaller kingdom of Judah  with its capital at
        Jerusalem  from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule  The Bible
        tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms
        aroused the fury of the great Prophets 
        In 701 b c  the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed
        Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem  Thanks to King
        Hezekiah’s hidden water tunnel  the city narrowly escaped destruction 
        The end of David’s dynasty came in 587 b c    when Nebuchadnezzar  King
        of Babylon  invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem  When it fell  the
        Temple and all the buildings were burned  The people of the
        once glorious city were forced into an exile known as “the Babylonian
        Captivity  ”
        In time  the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the
        Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b c  The city
        was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians  but rebuilding
        was slow work  The Second Temple was finished in 515 b c    but much of
        the city still lay in ruins 
        Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in
        332 b c  under Alexander the Great and  subsequently  to his
        Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian
        Seleucids  When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism  Jews led by Judah
        Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b c  and  against
        all odds  restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem 
        The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of
        pagan sacrifices  the eight day celebration of Hanukkah  Feast of
        Dedication  commemorates their victory  The Hasmonean dynasty 
        descendants of the Maccabee family  ruled an independent Jewish
        Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee  Jerusalem
        grew  surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside
        the Jaffa Gate  The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey’s Roman legions
        arrived in 63 b c 
        Roman Jerusalem
        After the initial years of Roman administration and
        political infighting  Rome installed Herod  scion of a family from
        Idumea  a Jewish kingdom in the desert  as King of Judea  He reigned
        from 37 to 4 b c    during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall
        and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate  the foundation of
        which still stand  Several palaces were built and a water system
        installed  Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple  making it one of
        the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire  The courtyard
        around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of
        pilgrims  and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made
        with great stone blocks  One of these walls  the Western Wall  is today
        a major reminder of Jerusalem’s greatness under Herod  A massive
        fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount  which Herod named
        “Antonia” in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor  Mark Antony 
        For all his accomplishments  Herod was nevertheless hated
        by his subjects  he taxed  he tortured  and he ordered the massacre of
        male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah 
        When Jesus was born in about 4 b c    Joseph and Mary escaped Herod’s
        paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new born infant  They returned
        to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth  making pilgrimages to
        Jerusalem 
        According to biblical accounts  Jesus spent his life
        ministering in the Galilee Valley  In about a d  30 he and his
        followers went for Passover to Jerusalem  which was in unrest at this
        time  dissatisfied with Roman domination  Jesus’s entry into the Temple
        caused a commotion  after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the
        temple priests  who were under direct Roman rule  Jesus was put on
        trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion  a Roman form of execution
        for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals 
        In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation  the execution in
        Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by
        itself have an immediate effect on history 
        After Jesus’s crucifixion  harsh Roman rule continued until
        a d  66  when the Jews rebelled  For four years Jewish zealots fought
        against the might of Rome  At the end  the Roman general Titus laid
        siege to Jerusalem in a d  70  finally attacking its starved and
        weakened defenders  Those who didn’t escape were executed or sold into
        slavery  The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed  The last of the
        zealots held out for another three years at Masada  see page 76   Half
        a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this
        first revolt against Rome  a number unequaled in ancient warfare 
        Christian and Islamic Jerusalem
        For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins  until the Roman
        Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to
        Jupiter  In outrage  the Jews began a second revolt against Rome  led
        by Simon bar Kochba  The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated 
        but  in the end  Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss
        of life  The planned new Roman city  Aelia Capitolina  was built over
        the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem  and Jews were barred from residing
        there for all time  Jerusalem’s physical existence as a spiritual city
        seemed finished  but its spiritual power for Jews  and for the
        struggling new Christian religion  remained  For the next two centuries
        Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history 
        But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth
        century  and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again  Queen
        Helena  a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the
        Great  made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites
        associated with Jesus’s life  She found that the city’s most beautiful
        Roman temple  dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite  stood on the site of
        the crucifixion  The temple was demolished and a vast  Classical style
        church was built around Golgotha  the hill where Jesus’s crucifixion
        was believed to have taken place   Throughout Jerusalem  other spots
        important to Jesus’s life were commemorated with religious structures 
        Pilgrims came from all over the Roman  and  later  Byzantine  Empire
        during the following centuries  but the prosperity they brought lasted
        only until 614  when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced
        Jerusalem to rubble again  In 629  Jerusalem was recaptured by the
        Byzantines 
        Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation 
        Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam  The Temple Mount
        was identified in Islamic tradition as “the farthest spot”  in Arabic 
        el aksa   the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one
        night from Mecca on a winged horse  as described in the 17th chapter of
        the Koran  From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was
        permitted to glimpse paradise  The rock on the Temple Mount from which
        he ascended  at or close to the site of the ruined Temple  was
        commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691  The
        Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem’s most striking monument  it is
        counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created  By about 715 
        the El Aksa Mosque  third holiest place of prayer in Islam  after Mecca
        and Medina   had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount 
        Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half
        centuries  In 1099  under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and
        Tancred  the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by
        slaughtering both Muslims and Jews 
        Crusaders  Mamelukes  and Turks
        The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with
        Godfrey at its head  They built many impressive churches during the
        term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem  but in 1187 they were
        driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin  During the
        Sixth Crusade  1228– 1229   the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed
        to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation 
        The Christians  however  could not hold the city  After
        they lost Jerusalem  a Mongol invasion swept through  and in 1244 the
        Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control  ruling Jerusalem for the next
        250 years  The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and
        invasions  Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was
        constructed in the Mameluke era  but the past thousand years had taken
        their toll  Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had
        enjoyed in earlier times 
        In the early 16th century  the Ottoman Turkish Empire was
        advancing through the Middle East  Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in
        1517  remaining under their control for 400 years  Suleiman the
        Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this
        day  Fountains  inns  religious schools  and barracks were constructed 
        But when Suleiman died  his empire  including Jerusalem  began a long
        period of decline  The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th
        century  when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the
        destination of thousands of travelers each year 
        19th Century Aspirations
        At the same time  many Jews sought religious freedom and
        fulfillment by moving to Palestine  as the Holy Land was traditionally
        called  and especially to Jerusalem  In the 1890s  Theodor Herzl
         1860–1904  worked to organize a movement  Zionism  to create a Jewish
        state  Chaim Weizmann  1874–1952   a scientist born in Russia but later
        a British subject  did much to put Herzl’s hopes into practice 
        Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British
        government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917  supporting the
        idea of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine that also respected the
        rights of existing non Jewish people already living there  The problem
        was that British strategists  who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in
        1917  had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab
        allies 
        In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate
        to administer Palestine  Jerusalem flourished during the early years of
        the Mandate  Modern neighborhoods  hospitals  schools  and the Hebrew
        University were built in West Jerusalem  the new Jewish enclave  But
        Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine
        led to increasing strife  by 1946  Jerusalem was an armed camp  In 1947
        the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two
        states  one Jewish and one Arab  with Jerusalem as an international
        city that belonged to neither  But lacking the means to enforce its
        decision  the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that
        erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948 
        Modern Israel
        The State of Israel was declared during this difficult
        time  In response  member states of the Arab League sent troops to help
        the Palestinian Arabs  West Jerusalem  separated from the rest of the
        new Jewish nation  held out under siege for several months until
        Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the
        coastal areas  Jews were evacuated from the Old City’s Jewish Quarter 
        and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem  As a
        result of armistice agreements in 1949  Jerusalem was divided  West
        Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control  and East Jerusalem
         including the Old City  with its Jewish  Muslim  Christian  and
        Armenian quarters  came under Jordanian authority  Free access to holy
        sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice
        agreements  However  with the city partitioned by fortifications and
        barbed wire  no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the
        Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem 
        For the next 19 years  Jerusalem was two cities  Political
        and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of
        terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967  Within three
        days the city was completely in Israeli hands  and in two weeks it was
        physically and administratively reunited  Jerusalem’s mayor  Teddy
        Kollek  spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of
        development  adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting
        neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the
        concerns of Jerusalem’s many communities 
        Today  as always  Jerusalem is a city of controversies 
        religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews  Palestinians calling for
        independence  many residents protesting a wave of high rise development
        that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis  But
        the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily
        special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present day
        Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world’s attention into the new
        millennium
